The modification to the 2016 consent decree will be subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Pollutant Impacts When fully implemented, the new controls and requirements under the Consent Decree Modification are estimated to achieve the following emissions reductions, in tons per year (tpy): If Tesoro Converts the Martinez Refinery to a Renewable Fuels Plant If Tesoro converts the facility to a renewable fuels plant, the Consent Decree Modification requires Tesoro to retire and forego annual emissions credits of the following pollutants: NOx by approximately 440 tpy (includes the 122 tpy surrendered credits) SO2 by approximately 327 tpy Carbon monoxide by approximately 697 tpy VOCs by approximately 69 tpy Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by approximately 301 tpy Greenhouse gases (as carbon dioxide equivalent) by approximately 1,342,025 tpy A company can receive emission credits by shutting down equipment and then apply such credits to offset emissions from new projects or trade such credits to other companies for their use. By requiring Tesoro to surrender existing credits and forego petroleum related shutdown credits if it converts to a renewable fuels plant, the settlement prevents Tesoro and other local sources from using these credits. If Tesoro Resumes Petroleum Refining at the Martinez Refinery If Tesoro resumes petroleum refining at the Martinez Refinery, the Consent Decree Modification requires the installation of NOx controls and compliance with more stringent NOx emission limits. These requirements, together with the retirement of existing NOx emission credits, will reduce NOx emissions as follows: NOx by approximately 261 tpy (includes the 122 tpy surrender of credits) Contact Information Patrick W. Foley Senior Environmental Engineer U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2242A) 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Washington, DC 20460-0001 (202) 564-7978foley.patrick@epa.gov Civil Penalty Tesoro will pay a $27.5 million civil penalty, plus interest accruing from November 1, 2020. Health and Environmental Effects Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) – NOx can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. NOx plays a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) – High concentrations of SO2 affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children, and the elderly. SO2 is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) – VOCs, along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Particulate Matter (PM) – PM, especially fine particles (PM2.5), contain microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. PM is linked to a variety of problems, including increased respiratory symptoms such as irritation of the airways, coughing, or difficulty breathing, decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease. Greenhouse Gases (GHG) – The release of GHGs into the atmosphere traps heat. The continued release of GHGs at or above the current rate will increase average temperatures around the globe. Increases in global temperatures will most likely change our planet’s climate in ways that will have significant long-term effects on people and the Injunctive Relief The settlement is a modification to the 2016 consent decree (Consent Decree Modification) and has two sets of injunctive relief requirements depending on Tesoro’s choice to convert the refinery to a renewable fuels plant or restart petroleum refining. The Consent Decree Modification provides Tesoro with the flexibility to choose the future operations at the Martinez Refinery, so long as such operations adhere to the requirements of the Consent Decree Modification. The Consent Decree Modification also includes various on-site projects to mitigate the pollution resulting from the alleged violation. If Tesoro Converts the Martinez Refinery to a Renewable Fuels Plant NOx and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission reduction requirements for heaters and boilers Requirements for control of flaring events Requirements for leak detection and repair Permanent shutdown of many petroleum refinery emission units Partial demolition of the FCCU and No. 6 Boiler to render them permanently inoperable Mitigation Project: prohibition on the use of emission reduction credits generated from the permanent shutdown of petroleum refinery emission units Exception: 12 tons per year NOx, one ton per year SO2, and ten tons per year volatile organic compounds (VOC) used to permit the conversion to a renewable fuels plant If Tesoro Resumes Petroleum Refining at the Martinez Refinery Because Tesoro has yet to convert the Martinez Refinery to a renewable fuels facility, the Consent Decree Modification includes the following requirements (in addition to the 2016 Consent Decree requirements) that apply if Tesoro resumes petroleum refining: Install selective catalytic reduction control technology on the FCCU prior to restarting the FCCU (estimated cost of $125 million) Mitigation Project: implement more stringent NOx emission limits on the FCCU Mitigation Project: implement more stringent NOx emission limits on the No. 6 Boiler, which was the third largest NOx-emitting source at the Martinez Refinery prior to the 2020 suspension of refinery operations (estimated cost of $1.2 million) Additional Mitigation Project Whether Tesoro converts the Martinez Refinery to a renewable fuels plant or resumes petroleum refining, the Consent Decree Modification requires Tesoro to surrender 122 tons per year of its existing NOx emission trading credits, which is most of its existing NOx emission credits. Overview of Company Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company (Tesoro) is the owner and operator of the Martinez Refinery, located about 30 miles northeast of San Francisco. In October 2018, about three months after the alleged violation began, Marathon Petroleum Corporation acquired Tesoro’s parent corporation, resulting in Tesoro becoming an indirect subsidiary of Marathon. Tesoro suspended operations at the Martinez Refinery in May 2020 and announced its plan to convert the refinery from producing fuels from crude oil to fuels from renewable sources such as vegetable oils. In May 2022, Contra Costa County approved the renewable fuels project, and, in September 2022, Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued a construction permit for the project. Prior to idling in May 2020, the Martinez Refinery had a refining capacity of approximately 161,000 barrels per day and was the fourth largest petroleum refinery in California. Tesoro expects it will begin production of renewable fuels in early 2023 and achieve full production of 48,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels by the end of 2023. The renewable fuels part of the former Martinez Refinery will be operated by Tesoro but owned by Martinez Renewables LLC. Martinez Renewables LLC has agreed to comply with the terms of the settlement. Violations EPA and the Justice Department allege that Tesoro violated a Clean Air Act requirement at the Martinez Refinery related to Tesoro’s compliance with a 2016 consent decree. Specifically, from July 1, 2018, through about May 1, 2020 (when Tesoro suspended refinery operations), Tesoro failed to comply with a 20 parts per million nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission limit at the Martinez Refinery fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU). FCCUs are major sources of air pollution at petroleum refineries.","$27,500,000"

Injunctive Relief Under the CD, Highland will increase its peak pumping flow capacity, by a factor of more than 4, in order to pump excessive wet weather sanitary wastewater flows to HSD and thus prevent SSOs from Highland’s sewer collection system. Highland will spend approximately $61.5 million to implement this solution, in addition to spending more than $21.7 million for additional costs related to HSD’s Long-Term Control Plan (LTCP). Highland will implement its projects in three phases; all of the phases will be completed by February 1, 2033. Overview of Company Highland and the adjacent community of Griffith, Indiana, both do not own/operate a Wastewater Treatment Plant, instead both communities send their untreated wastewater to the Hammond Sanitary District’s WWTP for treatment. Highland has a population of approximately 23,900 persons and is part of the metropolitan area of the City of Chicago. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The CD resolves extensive water pollution in the form of raw sewage flowing into urban waterways in northwest Indiana. Highland and Griffith will be required to eliminate all SSOs flowing from their sanitary sewer infrastructure, including by increasing capacity to pump additional waste to Hammond for treatment. Violations On December 9, 2002, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana entered the Consent Decrees settling actions under the Clean Water Act (CWA) with Defendant Sanitary District of Highland (“Highland”) and the Town of Griffith (collectively “Defendants”). The CDs had been lodged in April of 2022. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) was a co-plaintiff. The violations at issue were from numerous sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) from Highland's sanitary sewer collection system into waters of the United States, including the Little Calumet River. Defendants do not have National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits regulating discharges from their sanitary sewer systems. Instead, Defendants collect wastewater in their sanitary sewer collection systems and convey this wastewater to the separate Hammond Sanitary District (HSD) for treatment. During significant wet weather events, untreated wastewater discharges flow, as SSOs, from unauthorized discharge points in the Defendants systems into the Little Calumet River or its tributaries. Since 2012, Highland has discharged in this way over 175 separate times (some over several day periods). The Complaint alleged that each discharge violated Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a). Pollutant Impacts EPA estimates that implementation of the Highland CD will prevent approximately 10.98 million gallons of SSO discharge volume annually. The prevention of these SSOs will eliminate discharge of about 81,814 pounds of pollutants per year.","3750,000"

Injunctive Relief WDJG has agreed to the following injunctive relief at the Fort Lupton Complex: Comply with NSPS Subpart OOOOa; Implement an enhanced LDAR program—which includes more robust requirements for detecting and repairing leaks, and replacing and improving equipment—to bring the Fort Lupton Complex into compliance with LDAR regulations and mitigate the environmental harm caused by the alleged noncompliance; Implement fugitive leak monitoring for all equipment, including fin fan heat exchangers, using optical gas imaging instrumentation; and Amend relevant permits to incorporate consent decree requirements that will survive the decree’s termination. To mitigate the environmental harm caused by its alleged noncompliance, WDJG has also agreed to the following measures at its Fredrick Compressor Station: Convert two existing glycol dehydrators to closed-loop zero-emitting dehydrators; and Permanently take two engines that were installed prior to 1981 out of service. The Frederick Compressor Station is located in Weld County, Colorado. Overview of Company WES DJ Gathering LLC (WDJG)—formerly known as Kerr-McGee Gathering LLC—is a limited liability company formed in the State of Colorado. WDJG is a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Midstream Partners, LP—an affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. WDJG gathers, treats, compresses, processes, transports, and markets natural gas and natural gas liquids. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits VOCs contribute to smog, and to sensory irritation symptoms, allergies and asthma, and neurological and liver toxicity. Certain VOCs are also known carcinogens. NOx emissions contribute to smog as well as acid rain, particulate matter, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. VOCs and NOx are key components in the formation of smog or ground-level ozone, a pollutant that irritates the lungs, exacerbates diseases such as asthma, and can increase susceptibility to respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchitis. NOx reacts with VOCs in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. Children, people with respiratory illness, the elderly, and those working or exercising outdoors have a higher risk of harm from breathing ozone. Ground-level ozone is one of six criteria pollutants for which EPA has promulgated National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) due to its adverse effects on human health and the environment. The Fort Lupton Complex is located in an area of Colorado where air quality fails to meet the relevant standards for ground-level ozone and is currently considered to be in severe nonattainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is the primary component of natural gas and substantially contributes to climate change. Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Through the implementation of the settlement’s injunctive relief, WDJG will improve air quality in the ozone nonattainment area. Violations On July 1, 2020, the United States and the State of Colorado filed a complaint alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and the Colorado Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act at the Fort Lupton Complex.

Injunctive Relief Matador will spend at least $2,500,000 to implement injunctive relief requirements imposed at all 239 New Mexico facilities, including: field surveys, in which the company is required to address all compromised equipment and potential for excess VOC emissions; engineering design evaluations at subject vapor control systems, requiring the company to perform any necessary modifications to ensure each vapor control system is properly designed and sized; directed inspection and maintenance activities at subject facilities to ensure proper upkeep and operation of vapor control systems and associated operations; an integrated monitoring program for subject vapor control systems, employing automation to maximize recovery of vapors and to prevent excess emissions, including use of storage vessel pressure monitoring, vapor recovery unit (VRU) availability monitoring, flare pilot monitoring, control system bypass monitoring, and flare valve position monitoring; utilization of innovative technologies in lieu of periodic inspections; and, a third-party verification program examining the company’s compliance with all aspects of the Consent Decree’s injunctive relief requirements. Matador will spend approximately $800,000 to perform the following mitigation projects: Replace no fewer than 300 existing intermittent-bleed and 100 existing low continuous-bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controllers with non-emitting controllers at its New Mexico facilities by January 1, 2025. Matador will ensure that 85 percent of its total controller count in New Mexico are non-emitting controllers; and, Convert three existing natural gas-powered VRUs to electric-drive variable speed VRUs by January 1, 2025. Overview of Company Matador Production Company (Matador) is a subsidiary of Matador Resources Company, a publicly traded oil and gas exploration and production company incorporated in Texas with operations in New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. The consolidated Matador Resources Company has net assets of approximately $2.3 billion. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria pollutants that are considered harmful to public health and the environment. Ozone, CO and nitrogen dioxide (NO2, a component of NOx) are criteria pollutants emitted by oil and gas production facilities, such as those operated by Matador where the alleged violations occurred. During the timeframes of Matador’s alleged violations, air quality monitors in the relevant counties in New Mexico registered rising ozone concentrations exceeding 95% of the NAAQS for ozone. In counties where ozone levels reach 95% of the NAAQS, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) is required by New Mexico state statute to take action to reduce ozone pollution. VOCs and NOx are key components in the formation of ground-level ozone, a pollutant that irritates the lungs, exacerbates diseases such as asthma, and can increase susceptibility to respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchitis. In addition, as a co-benefit of these reductions, the consent decree will result in significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, Greenhouse gases from human activities are a primary cause of climate change and global warming. Violations The proposed Consent Decree addresses Clean Air Act (CAA) violations of the following: Standards of Performance for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Facilities for Which Construction, Modification or Reconstruction Commenced After September 18, 2015, 40 C.F.R.

Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Contact Information Dave Deegan US EPA, New England Region Office of Public AffairsO: (617) 918-1017 M: (617) 594-7068deegan.dave@epa.gov Civil Penalty The Consent Decree requires payment of a $50,000 civil penalty for past noncompliance, an amount consistent with EPA’s penalty policy. The penalty will be shared with our co-plaintiff’s, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Injunctive Relief In addition to incorporating the City’s CSO Long Term Control Plan and schedule into an enforceable Consent Decree, and requiring MS4 compliance, this phase of CSO work requires the City to separate CSO area No. 21 (“River Terrace”) at a cost of over 16 million dollars thereby removing an average of 58 million gallons per year of CSO flow. The Decree also requires the City to update and submit an MS4 illicit discharge detection and elimination (IDDE) plan to incorporate up-to-date stormwater sampling criteria. The City must also finish sampling all of its stormwater outfalls in dry and wet weather and incorporate best management practices into its stormwater pollution prevention plan to reduce nitrogen discharges from stormwater entering the Connecticut River. Overview of Company The Holyoke wastewater pollution control facility (WPCF) serves a population of approximately 37,000. Holyoke owns and operates a sewer collection system that services approximately 70% of the City, two-thirds of which carries both sewage and stormwater. The City is located directly on the banks of the Connecticut River. Compliance with this Consent Decree, and ultimately the Clean Water Act, will benefit a community that is already economically disadvantaged by ensuring that its residents who live along the Connecticut River have clean and safe water. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Sewer separation will result in an average reduction of 17 million gallons per year of combined sewage overflow to the Connecticut River, reduction of nitrogen discharge as well as the removal of 58 million gallons of combined sewage from outfalls within the City. Violations The CD addresses alleged violations of Section 301(a) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a), against Holyoke for illegal combined sewer overflow (“CSO”) discharges. Most of the time, the combined system transports all wastewater to the facility for treatment. However, during periods of heavy rain the wastewater volume can exceed the capacity of the sewer system or the treatment facility and the excess wastewater will discharge to the Connecticut River without treatment. The Consent Decree resolves Clean Water Act (CWA) noncompliance by the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts, specifically with respect to the City’s discharges from the combined sewer outfalls in its sewer collection system. Pollutant Impacts During periods of heavy rain, the wastewater volume can exceed the capacity of the sewer- system or the treatment facility and the excess wastewater will discharge to the Connecticut River without treatment. CSO discharges contain raw sewage and are a major water pollution concern. The impact of the work done pursuant to the CD will reduce and ultimately eliminate the discharge of pollutants for the collection and sewer system into the Connecticut River. The amount of nitrogen discharges into the Connecticut River will also be significantly reduced, resulting in improved water quality for all residents along the River.","50,000"

Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, is subject to a 30-day federal public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice website. Pollutant Reductions Industrial stormwater permits require industrial operators to develop SWPPPs and implement practices that minimize pollutants in stormwater. ABF’s implementation of the corporate-wide stormwater compliance program required by the proposed consent decree will reduce the discharge of pollutants from its transportation facilities into waterways. For more information, contact: Sean Ireland Water Enforcement Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW (Mail Code 2243A) Washington, DC, 20460 (202) 564-2923ireland.sean@epa.gov State Partner EPA has collaborated with several states to achieve this settlement. Co-signatories to the consent decree are: LDEQ, the State of Maryland, and the State of Nevada. Health and Environmental Effects The settlement will result in stormwater management improvements for communities across the country. Stormwater runoff is generated from rain and snowmelt events that flow over land or impervious surfaces, such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops, and does not soak into the ground. The runoff picks up pollutants like trash, chemicals, oils, and dirt/sediment that can harm rivers, streams, lakes, and coastal waters. Pollutants in stormwater can cause changes in hydrology and water quality that result in habitat modification and loss, increased flooding, decreased aquatic biological diversity, and increased sedimentation and erosion. The injunctive relief in the proposed consent decree is designed to result in effective stormwater runoff management at ABF transportation facilities. Overview of Company ABF is a corporation organized under the laws of Arkansas, with its principal place of business in Fort Smith, Arkansas. ABF is a subsidiary of ArcBest Corporation and is one of the largest trucking companies in North America. ABF facilities fall under Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) code 4213 (Motor Freight Transportation) and conducts loading and unloading of goods at its facilities and performs “industrial activities” at many of these facilities, including vehicle maintenance and equipment cleaning. Facilities classified as SIC code 4213 are covered under Sector P (Land Transportation and Warehousing) of the federal industrial stormwater multi-sector general permit. Typical pollutants of concern at these types of facilities that could adversely impact water quality include fuel, oil, grease, leaking or spilled vehicle fluids, solvents, heavy metals, detergents, and total suspended solids. The consent decree covers all transportation facilities that ABF owns and operates while the consent decree is in effect. Currently, ABF owns and operates over 200 transportation facilities across the country. Civil Penalty ABF will pay a civil penalty of $535,000 to resolve this matter, divided as follows: $483,064 to the United States $18,214.50 to the State of Maryland $18,065 to LDEQ $15,656.50 to the State of Nevada Violations In 2013 and 2014, ABF voluntarily conducted stormwater compliance audits at most of its facilities and found widespread noncompliance with CWA requirements relating to stormwater. The noncompliance ABF found included facilities discharging stormwater associated with industrial activities to waters of the United States without a permit and facilities with an applicable CWA permit failing to comply with the conditions of that permit (e.g., inadequate sampling, reporting, and recordkeeping deficiencies). In April 2015, ABF voluntarily disclosed to EPA its noncompliance with the CWA. Between October 2016 and April 2019, EPA, LDEQ, the State of Maryland, and the State of Nevada conducted 15 inspections of ABF’s facilities to evaluate ABF’s compliance with stormwater laws. The inspections were conducted at facilities located in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada and Ohio. The inspections revealed issues at both permitted facilities and facilities that had filed for No Exposure Certificates (NEC) pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 122.26 or an equivalent state provision in an authorized state. These issues included inadequate implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (including improper outdoor storage of chemicals, oil/grease and other vehicle fluids; poor housekeeping; improper storage of road salt; uncontained stockpiles; washing of truck windshields without BMPs); outdated stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPPs) that did not meet all permit requirements (including failure to identify and address all pollutant sources); improper visual monitoring; inadequate inspections; and insufficient employee training.",535000
9,"The Elyria, Ohio Clean Water Act Settlement"," (Washington, DC – November 9, 2022) - The city of Elyria, Ohio, has entered into a consent decree with the United States and the State of Ohio to complete a series of capital projects designed to eliminate discharges of untreated sewage from its sewer system into the Black River, 10 miles upstream from Lake Erie. On this page:",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/elyria-ohio-clean-water-act-settlement-information-sheet,Consent Decree,2022-11-09,"Settlement Resources The City of Elyria, Ohio Consent Decree (pdf) (4.41 MB) Overview of Company Violations Injunctive Relief Pollutant Impacts Health and Environmental Effects Civil Penalty Comment Period Contact Total Suspended Solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients – Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive Injunctive Relief The proposed settlement includes specific requirements to address SSOs, CSOs and bypasses of wastewater treatment. The consent decree requires completion of the construction and full implementation of all projects and pollution control measures by no later than December 31, 2044. The total cost of implementing these measures is estimated to be approximately $248 million. SSOs – Elyria shall complete sewer system improvements designed to eliminate SSOs. Specifically, the storage and sewage conveyance project known as the East Side Relief Sewer will consist of large diameter sewer measuring nearly five miles in length. The city will also complete various pump station improvements, and construction and rehabilitation of sanitary and storm sewers to reduce inflow and infiltration. CSOs – Along with the construction of the East Side Relief Sewer the city will construct outfall specific storage projects sized up to 110,000 gallons to control CSOs to no more than 4 events with a total annual volume of less than six million gallons of discharge during the typical year. Bypasses – Construct and implement improvements at the WWTP to expand peak treatment capacity at the WWTP from 30 million gallons per day to 40 million gallons per day.

Overview PCS Nitrogen’s Geismar Facility consists of a main plant, including the former sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and fertilizer manufacturing plants, and phosphogypsum stacks (Gypsum Stacks) and associated surface impoundments. The Gypsum Stacks and associated surface impoundments together are referred to as the Gypsum Stack System. The Facility, originally built by Allied Signal Corp., has operated since 1967 and encompasses approximately 1,050 acres. Gypsum stacking began in the early 1970s. PCS Nitrogen continued disposal of wastes from the main plant in the Gypsum Stacks, which are located two miles north of the main plant between Highway 30 & Highway 3115. The phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid plants ceased operations in 2018 and as such, the Gypsum Stacks also ceased receiving phosphogypsum generated from phosphoric acid production at that time. Closure wastes from decommissioning the phosphoric acid plant were also disposed in the Gypsum Stacks, in accordance with LDEQ permits and approvals. From at least February 2004 until December 2012, a neighboring third-party generator (Innophos, Inc.) routinely piped and/or shipped its hazardous waste streams (Raffinate and Dearsenate) to the Geismar Facility, where PCS Nitrogen stored approximately 20,000 gallons of Dearsenate per day and disposed of both hazardous waste streams, either directly or indirectly, into its Gypsum Stacks. In 2012, and pursuant to a Consent Decree entered on October 3, 2017 (Civil Action No. 17-26-SDD-RLB), Innophos, Inc. ceased sending these hazardous wastes to the PCS Nitrogen Facility for disposal. From 2018 to present, PCS Nitrogen decommissioned and dismantled the phosphoric acid manufacturing plant, initiated closure of the Gypsum Stack System, repaired certain Gypsum Stack System liners, and installed a water treatment system. Work completed to date at the Geismar Facility has been done pursuant to the approved solid waste closure plans under Solid Waste Permit Nos. P-0201, P-0201R1, and P-0201R2. Environmental Benefits In a national enforcement effort, EPA has focused on compliance in the phosphoric acid industry because of the high risk of releases of acidic wastewaters at these facilities, where these facilities are located in areas such as Geismar, that are prone to significant rain events and strong storms, increasing the risk of destabilizing the Gypsum Stack System or wastewater overtopping and subsequent release of hazardous constituents to the environment. Through construction of a wastewater treatment system for the appropriate treatment of hazardous wastewaters and capping and closing of the Gypsum Stack System, PCS will reduce the potential for groundwater and surface water impacts. In addition, repair of the Active Clearwell, and previously completed repairs to the Inactive Clearwell, should further decrease the risk of potential releases of hazardous waste to the environment at the Facility. Violations In February 2004, EPA and LDEQ conducted an on-site RCRA inspection of the Geismar Facility which included a comprehensive review of the Facility’s processes and operations and corresponding waste generation, discussions with Facility personnel, sampling of waste streams, and analysis of the waste samples. EPA performed subsequent re-inspections of the Facility, including in April 2005 and December 2017. In the complaint lodged with the court, Plaintiffs allege the following RCRA violations: Failure to make hazardous waste determinations (LAC 33:V.1103); Failure to perform land disposal restriction determinations (LAC 33:V.2245); Storage of hazardous waste (Dearsenate) without a permit or interim status (LAC 33:V.303.B, 305 and 501); Treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste in the Gypsum Stack System, surface impoundments, and tanks, and leaking/disposal of hazardous wastes outside the Gypsum Stack System, without a permit or interim status (LAC 33:V.303.B, 305, and 501); Failure to submit required hazardous waste generation annual reports to the LDEQ (LAC 33:V.1529.D); Failure to establish an adequate cost estimate for closure of all units that received hazardous waste (LAC 33:V.3705.A); Failure to establish adequate financial assurance for closure of all units that received hazardous waste (LAC 33:V.3707); Failure to prepare an adequate cost estimate for post-closure of all units that received hazardous waste (LAC 33:V.3709.A); Failure to establish adequate financial assurance for post-closure of all units that received hazardous waste (LAC 33:V.3711); and Failure to establish adequate financial assurance for third party liability at the Geismar Facility (LAC 33:V.3715.A). Pollutant Impacts The settlement requires PCS Nitrogen to treat over 1 billion pounds of acidic hazardous process wastewater over the next several years. The acidic hazardous process wastewaters will be contained in the Gypsum Stack System and then treated in the newly constructed water treatment plant.","$1,510,023"
11,Agreement continues lead cleanup work and redevelopment at USS Lead Superfund Site," EPA), and the State of Indiana reached an agreement with several potentially responsible parties (PRPs) that will allow for continued cleanup and redevelopment of the USS Lead Superfund site in East Chicago, Indiana. Under the administrative settlement agreement and order on consent (ASAOC), the PRPs will provide financial assurance to ensure funding for the cleanup should IDA not be able to satisfactorily complete the work, reimburse the Agency $18 million for its past cleanup costs at the site, and pay for future state and EPA oversight costs at the site. Along with the ASAOC, the Agency proposes to enter into a prospective purchaser agreement (PPA) with Industrial Development Advantage of East Chicago, LLC (IDA), a developer who will perform the cleanup work on the site. The Agency will also issue a draft explanation of significant differences (ESD) to confirm that the cleanup work is required to meet industrial rather than residential cleanup standards for the area of the site that is subject to the PPA. On May 4, 2022, EPA announced a 30-day public comment period and in-person public meeting. The communities within and around the site have historically been overburdened by pollution and have expressed concerns particularly about the health risks associated with exposure to lead. The cleanup work at the site addresses soil contamination of lead and arsenic from the manufacture and production activities of several industrial facilities between 1906 and 1985.

The site includes part of the former USS Lead facility along with nearby commercial, municipal, and residential areas. The primary contaminants of concern are lead and arsenic. The site is divided into two operable units (OUs), OU1 and OU2. OU1 consists primarily of residential properties and for administrative purposes has been divided into three zones (Zones 1, 2, and 3). Cleanup work in zones 2 and 3 is complete. The PPA, ASAOC, and ESD address the cleanup of Zone 1. During the middle decades of the 20th century, Zone 1 was the site of a lead smelter and processing facility operated by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. These operations, along with the operations of other nearby industrial facilities, caused contamination of the site with lead and arsenic. The Anaconda facility was demolished in the early 1970s, leaving behind in Zone 1 lead and arsenic contaminated soils. The West Calumet Housing Complex (WCHC) was built on top of the contaminated soil in 1973 and during the next forty-five years was home to thousands of residents. In 2017 and 2018, the WCHC was demolished, and its residents relocated. The WCHC, the adjacent Goodman Park, and a utility corridor in the eastern portion of Zone 1 are referred to in the settlement agreements as “Modified Zone 1.” In 2012, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for all OU1, which established both residential and commercial cleanup standards for arsenic and lead. In 2014, EPA entered into an agreement with certain PRPs to cleanup up Zones 1 and 3 under the ROD’s residential cleanup standards. After the demolition of the West Calumet Housing Complex in late 2019, the City of East Chicago signed a letter of intent with IDA for the purchase of a portion of Zone 1, known as Modified Zone 1, for the development of a warehouse and transportation center. In 2020, to accommodate either residential or commercial redevelopment of Modified Zone 1, EPA issued an amendment to the 2012 ROD, which provided for an industrial remedy to Modified Zone 1 if (1) the zoning classification changed from residential to light industrial, and (2) the property titles to the Modified Zone 1 were transferred to a person or company with plans to develop the area for commercial/industrial use. In May 2020, the East Chicago Common Council changed the zoning classification of Modified Zone 1 to light industrial. Following the rezoning, IDA signed the PPA with EPA to implement the ESD’s commercial cleanup standards for Modified Zone 1. The cleanup work will begin after IDA acquires the parcels and EPA issues the ESD. More information is available from the EPA’s USS Lead Superfund site profile web page. Comment Period Beginning on May 4, 2022, the ASAOC, PPA and ESD are subject to a 30-day public comment period. Additionally, EPA is holding an in-person public meeting on May 21, 2022. More information on the public comment period is available on the USS Lead Superfund site profile web page and on the DOJ’s website. Contact Information For more information contact Steven P. Kaiser Associate Regional Counsel kaiser.steven@epa.gov Jamie D. Getz Associate Regional Counsel getz.jamie@epa.gov U.S. EPA Region 5 77 West Jackson Boulevard Chicago, IL 60604 Overview of the Settlement Agreements and Explanation of Significant Differences The ASAOC, PPA and ESD are being issued by EPA to ensure that remedial action is completed in OU1. The PPA and ASAOC will complete the cleanup work in OU1. EPA and DOJ use prospective purchaser agreements (PPAs) or prospective lessee agreements (PLAs) to address the liability concerns of third parties who want to cleanup and reuse contaminated properties. Under the ASAOC, the parties are ensuring funding for the cleanup work for Modified Zone 1, which will be performed by IDA, the developer, under the PPA. The parties will also reimburse EPA for $18 million in past cleanup costs, pay for future state and federal response actions, and pay EPA and the state’s costs for overseeing the cleanup work. In addition, Arava Natural Resources Company, Inc., Mining Remedial Recovery Company, and Mueller Industries, Inc. are signing the ASAOC as “Additional Covered Parties.” The Additional Covered Parties will receive a covenant for the work at the USS Lead Superfund site and contribution protection. The Additional Covered Parties are waiving their rights under CERCLA § 106(b) to petition for past costs they may have spent to comply with administrative orders issued for areas within the site. The PPA requires IDA to perform the cleanup work in the Modified Zone 1 area. EPA will oversee IDA’s work to ensure that development on the site will not interfere with the integrity of the cleanup work in Zone 1 or the cleaned up properties in Zones 2 or 3. EPA is issuing the draft ESD to acknowledge that the contingencies outlined in the 2020 ROD amendment for Modified Zone 1, to allow for a commercial cleanup standard, based on rezoning and title transfer, as opposed to a residential remedy, has been met. An ESD describes the nature of the significant changes, summarizes the information that led to making the changes, and affirm that the revised remedy complies with the National Contingency Plan (NCP) and Superfund’s statutory requirements. After the public comment period, EPA and DOJ will prepare a responsiveness summary. If EPA, DOJ, and the State of Indiana conclude that it is in the public interest to proceed under the terms of the PPA and ASAOC, they will notify the public and the signatories to these agreements. Then, once IDA takes title to the Modified Zone 1 property, EPA will issue the ESD. The PPA and ASAOC will become effective once the ESD is issued. Information about the Parties The parties to the ASAOC are the owners and operators, or the successors in interest, of the owners and operators of the industrial facilities whose operations contaminated the USS Lead Superfund site. Historic operations at several facilities including the former USS Lead facility, the former Anaconda facility, and the former DuPont facility contributed substantially to the lead and arsenic contamination at the site. The parties to the ASAOC are Atlantic Richfield Company, The Chemours Company FC, LLC, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc., and United States Metals Refining Company. The former USS Lead Facility was first owned and operated between 1906 and 1919 by United States Metals Refining Company (USMRC) and between 1920 and 1985 by U.S. Smelter and Lead Refinery, Inc. (USS Lead). USS Lead is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mining Remedial Recovery Company (MRRC), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Arava Natural Resources Company. Arava is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mueller Industries, Inc. Atlantic Richfield Company is the successor to liabilities of one or more companies that owned and operated the former Anaconda Facility between 1912 and at least 1946. Chemours is the successor owner by assignment of E.I. DuPont Nemours and Company, which owned and operated the former DuPont facility between 1891 and 2015.",18 million

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC was formed in the year 2000 through the merger of the chemical operation of the Chevron Corporation and Phillips 66. These two companies jointly own Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, a suburb of Houston, Texas. The company is a major producer of ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, alpha-olefins, polyalphaolefins, aromatic compounds and a range of specialty chemicals. The settlement involves the reduction of air pollution from petrochemical and chemical flares. A flare is a mechanical device, ordinarily elevated high off the ground, used to combust waste gases. Three facilities located in Cedar Bayou, Port Arthur, and Sweeny, Texas are covered in this settlement. The facilities subject to the settlement include two principal types of chemical plants: Olefins Plants. The primary products of these plants are ethylene and propylene, both of which are olefins. Ethylene is a feedstock for the production of consumer plastic products such as garbage bags, bread wrappers, packaging, and wire insulation. Propylene is also a feedstock used to produce products such as carpet, upholstery, boats, and car parts. Polymer Plants. The primary products of these plants are different grades of polyethylene, a polymer. Polyethylene is the feedstock for the production of consumer products such as food containers/packaging, carpet backing, diapers, pipe, truck bed liners, and shipping crates. Polyethylene is the most common plastic in the world. Pollutant Impacts Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs, along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Benzene - Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidences of leukemia have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene. EPA has classified benzene as a Group A human carcinogen. Greenhouse Gasses – Greenhouse Gases trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. This matter will result in the reduction of the following greenhouse gasses - carbon dioxide, ethane, and methane. The global warming potential of these gasses are normalized to the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. This metric is called carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Violations The complaint alleges violations of Clean Air Act requirements at Chevron Phillips’s flares that resulted in excess emissions of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) including benzene, and climate-change-causing greenhouse gases. The allegations include violations of: New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD) and Minor New Source Review, 40 C.F.R. Parts 51 and 52 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts A, Kb, VV, NNN, and RRR. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), 40 C.F.R.

Contact Information Ed Kulschinsky U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2242A) 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Washington, DC 20460kulschinsky.edward@epa.gov Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The Clean Air Act aims to reduce emissions from mobile sources of air pollution, including NOx. Mobile sources of air pollution contribute approximately 58% of the nation’s NOx emissions. EPA testing demonstrates that installing aftermarket parts can result in increased NOx emissions from mobile sources. NOx emissions pose significant health and environmental concerns. NOx form when fuel burns at high temperatures. NOx can travel long distances, causing a variety of health and environmental problems in locations far from their emissions source, including ozone and smog. NOx also contributes to the formation of PM through chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and PM can cause asthma, difficult or painful breathing, and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the elderly. It is also a major cause of substantial visibility impairment in many parts of the United States. The key health effects categories associated with ambient PM include premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma, and acute respiratory symptoms including aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis, and decreased lung function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and increased allergenicity have also been observed. Diesel exhaust PM is of special concern. The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely carcinogenic to humans. EPA estimates that the products PPEI and Willis sold between 2013 and 2018 may result in more than 100 million pounds of excess NOx emissions and 800,000 pounds of excess PM emissions over the anticipated remaining life of the diesel pickup trucks equipped with PPEI and Willis’s defeat devices. This enforcement action will prevent additional excess emissions that would have resulted from the continued sale of these illegal products. Overview of Company PPEI manufactures, markets, and sells aftermarket automotive products for diesel pickup trucks nationwide. PPEI is a Louisiana company located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Kory B. Willis is PPEI’s President and owner. PPEI conducts its business by selling to downstream retailers and also directly to individual customers through its website. Pollutant Impacts Today’s vehicles emit far less pollution than vehicles of the past. This is made possible by careful engine calibrations, and the use of filters and catalysts in the exhaust system. Aftermarket defeat devices undo this progress and pollute the air we breathe. The emissions impact depends on the original vehicle design and the extent of the vehicle modifications. EPA testing has shown that a vehicle’s emissions increase drastically (tens or hundreds of times, depending on the pollutant) when its emissions controls are removed. Here, PPEI and Willis’s defeat devices enabled the removal of the EGR systems, filters, catalysts, and other emissions control systems from diesel trucks that are necessary to treat air pollution formed in the engine before it is emitted into the ambient air. Diesel emissions include nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), hazardous air pollutants, and other pollutants. Violations PPEI and Willis manufactured and/or sold numerous aftermarket defeat devices designed for diesel pickup trucks. More specifically, between 2013 and 2018, PPEI and Willis manufactured and sold no fewer than 59,135 electronic tunes or tuning devices that disable filters, catalysts, EGR systems, and other critical emissions control devices equipped on diesel pickup trucks. PPEI and Willis also marketed and sold numerous other devices designed to disable or bypass exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems equipped on diesel pickup trucks, electronic tuning products that manipulated certified stock fueling calibrations, and empty exhaust pipes (a.k.a., “straight pipes”) designed to remove emissions aftertreatment systems. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and its regulations aim to protect human health and the environment by reducing harmful emissions from mobile sources of air pollution. The CAA authorizes the EPA to establish emissions standards and requires manufacturers of on-highway engines to apply for and obtain a certificate of conformity demonstrating compliance with emissions standards prior to introducing an engine into U.S. commerce. Certificates of conformity cover only those engines produced within a single model year. A model year for an engine family of engines ends either when the last such engine is produced, or on December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year is named, whichever date is sooner. These emissions control devices were installed on motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines by original equipment manufacturers (i.e., truck manufacturers) in order to comply with Clean Air Act emission standards. PPEI and Willis’s aftermarket products were designed for use with numerous models of vehicles, including diesel trucks manufactured by Ford and GM. Accordingly, the EPA alleges that each act of manufacturing and each sale constitutes a civil violation of Section 203(a)(3)(B) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. § 7522(a)(3)(B).","$1,550,000"

Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Injunctive Relief CCBH is required to maintain a newly installed cyanide treatment system to reduce cyanide at the Facility to maintain compliance with NPDES permit effluent limits. CCBH is also required to maintain and operate a newly installed pilot ammonia-N treatment system to reduce ammonia-N at the Facility, until CCBH installs a permanent ammonia-N removal system by May 2025. The proposed CD also requires compliance with approved O&M Plans. In addition, to help ensure that unpermitted cyanide and ammonia releases will not re-occur, CCBH will use, on an emergency basis, an existing lined leachate storage pond to retain blast furnace air scrubber water in the event the Blast Furnace recycle system is disabled and the scrubber system needs to operate. As a backstop, the Facility will shut down its furnaces before the pond is filled. CCBH must also comply with a Diversion Procedure Plan that includes specific provisions to reduce water flow to the pond from other sources when needed for retaining scrubber water, sample the pond water and other locations for cyanide and ammonia-N, treat and/or meter the pond water to maintain compliance with NPDES Permit effluent limits for ammonia-N and cyanide, and maintain compliance with pond capacity requirements. IDEM intends to include the Diversion Procedure Plan into the NPDES Permit. Finally, CCBH must conduct investigations and enhanced sampling to analyze all wastewater flows from the Facility and submit the results of that investigation to EPA and IDEM for review and approval. CCBH will also address deficiencies in its environmental management system and violation mitigation response and will implement increased notification regarding future exceedances to the local community.

Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20460Raack.Melissa @epa.gov Civil Penalty CCBH has agreed to pay a penalty of $3 million, that will be split with the State of Indiana. In addition, CCBH will reimburse EPA for $10,025.37 and IDEM for $37,650 in past response costs relating to the August 2019 unpermitted releases. Overview The Cleveland Cliffs Burns Harbor Facility, located in Burns Harbor, Indiana, is one of the largest fully integrated steel mills in North America, with the capacity to produce approximately five million tons of raw steel per year. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits In addition to IDEM as a co-plaintiff, two citizens groups, the Environment and Law Policy Center (ELPC) and the Hoosier Environmental Council (HEC) are co-plaintiffs. As a result of their inclusion, the State will manage two environmentally beneficial projects that will benefit the communities surrounding the Facility. CCBH will donate approximately 127 acres of land abutting the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and will perform enhanced monitoring in the East Branch of the Little Calumet River and Lake Michigan. Violations The Clean Water Act (CWA) violations addressed by the settlement involve several days of unpermitted releases of cyanide and ammonia nitrogen in August 2019 from the Facility. A pump failure resulted in discharges of untreated cyanide and ammonia nitrogen in exceedance of permit effluent limitations. EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) emergency response personnel responded to this release. The cyanide release killed hundreds of fish in the East Branch of the Little Calumet River. As a result of the release, Ogden Dunes Beach and the Indiana Dunes National Park were closed for seven days. CCBH also failed to provide timely notification and emergency reports to the local emergency response authorities after the release, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA.) Pollutant Impacts The proposed settlement will result in expected pollutant decreases of, among others, ammonia, cyanide, toxicity, phenolics, and oil and grease.",3000
15,"The Berkeley County Public Service Sewer District, West Virginia Clean Water Settlement"," (Washington, DC - November 17, 2021)  The Berkeley County Public Service Sewer District in West Virginia will pay a $518,400 penalty, make extensive improvements to its sewer and stormwater systems, and implement a state-directed supplemental environmental project valued at $1.14 million under a settlement with federal and state authorities, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) announced today.

Berkeley County will conduct a comprehensive assessment of its sanitary sewer system to identify defective sewer pipes and pump stations in poor condition. The assessment results will be used to prioritize rehabilitation efforts aimed to prevent the occurrence of future SSOs. During the first year of implementation of this settlement, Berkeley County will focus its efforts on assessing and rehabilitating portions of the county that have historically experienced SSOs, covering roughly 13% of the sewer system. No less than 65% of the sewer system will be assessed within 5 years of implementation. Berkeley County will conduct a system-wide capacity assessment and development a plan to address areas where SSOs have occurred or are predicted to occur, especially during large rain events. Berkeley County will implement a comprehensive performance evaluation and corrective action plans for several wastewater treatment facilities. The total cost of implementing these measures is estimated to be approximately $50 million over the 10-year period provided to complete the injunctive relief.

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Total Suspended Solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients – Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. Overview of Sewer Authority and Facilities The Berkeley County Public Service Sewer District (Berkeley County) provides wastewater collection and treatment for approximately 101,000 residents. Berkeley County’s wastewater and stormwater facilities includes approximately 245 miles of sewer pipes and 14 wastewater treatment plants that all discharge to the Potomac River or its tributaries, which are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Violations The United States alleges that Berkeley County violated terms and conditions of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, which set limits for how much of a certain pollutant an entity can discharge into a waterbody. The alleged violations include effluent limit exceedances and failure to prevent sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) through proper operation and maintenance of its system, and failure to develop and implement a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (“MS4”). Pollutant Reduction Through the implementation of the proposed Decree, the following estimated annual pollutant reductions will result: 2,303 pounds of total suspended solids; 107,127 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand; 212 pounds of total nitrogen; and 2,714 pounds of total phosphorus.","$864,000"
16,EPA’s Lead-based Paint Enforcement Helps Protect Children and Vulnerable Communities - 2021," (Washington, DC – October 27, 2021) –This webpage highlights federal enforcement actions completed between October 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021 to protect the public, especially young children, from exposure to lead in paint.  The cases here involve alleged noncompliance with at least one of EPA’s lead-based paint requirements: the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule; the TSCA Lead-based Paint Activities Rule; and the Lead Disclosure Rule under Section 1018 of the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act.  These requirements apply to most pre-1978 dwellings and to child-occupied facilities such as pre-schools and child-care centers. The EPA uses an array of mechanisms to enforce these laws and reduce the risk of lead exposure.  Lead-based paint enforcement actions generally include administrative civil settlements and orders by the EPA, and civil judicial settlements and criminal prosecutions by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Cases often result from referrals, tips and complaints from state or local authorities, consumers and others, including information related to children with elevated blood-lead levels. Enforcement actions aim to achieve compliance resulting in reductions in lead exposure and environmental contamination.  Actions to enforce EPA’s lead-based paint rules result in the reduction of human exposure to lead paint, most importantly for vulnerable populations such as young children and pregnant women.  Lead-contaminated dust from chipped or peeling lead-based paint in homes built prior to 1978 presents one of the most common causes of elevated blood lead levels in children.  Infants and children are especially vulnerable to lead paint exposure because their growing bodies absorb more lead than adults do, and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead.  Infants and children can be exposed from multiple sources and may experience irreversible and lifelong health effects.  Lead dust can be generated when lead-based paint deteriorates or when it is disturbed, such as during a renovation or repair that does not utilize EPA’s lead-safe work practices.

(FL) BJ Crawford LLC, d/b/a Crawford Properties (MS) Heiler Painting LLC (PA) SI Vision, LLC (OH) Window Universe Cleveland, LLC (OH) Additional Highlights Selected Highlights Home Depot U.S.A. Inc.* (Nationwide) Of the $20.75 million penalty, Home Depot will pay $750,000 to Utah, $732,000 to Massachusetts, and $50,000 to Rhode Island. The EPA discovered alleged violations of EPA and state lead-based paint Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rules when investigating customer complaints about Home Depot renovations in Regions 1, 5, and 9. The EPA broadened its investigation to look at 30 communities nationwide, which showed Home Depot subcontracted work to firms that in some cases were not certified by the EPA or an EPA-authorized state RRP program, did not use lead-safe work practices, perform required post-renovation cleaning, provide the EPA-required lead-based paint pamphlets to occupants, or maintain records of compliance with the law. In its investigation, the EPA used its EJSCREEN tool to target compliance assessment in communities overburdened by exposure to lead-based paint. When large national renovation firms like Home Depot do not comply with the law when performing renovations in communities with environmental justice concerns, they may exacerbate the disproportionate impact that lead poisoning has on neighborhoods already overburdened by lead hazards. Under the settlement, Home Depot will implement a company-wide program to ensure that the contractors it hires to perform work for its customers comply with the Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule during renovations of homes built before 1978. Home Depot will also conduct thousands of on-site inspections of work performed by its contractors to ensure they comply with lead-safe work practices. Home Depot must also investigate and respond to customer complaints. In instances where the contractor did not comply with Lead Safe Work practices, Home Depot will perform an inspection for dust lead hazards and, if they are found, provide a specialized cleaning. EPA will monitor Home Depot’s responses to customer complaints. In addition to the requirements related to its renovations, Home Depot will provide important information about following lead-safe work practices to its professional and do-it-yourself customers in its stores, on its website, on YouTube, and in workshops. Flipnmove Productions and EQ Media, Inc. (TX) involved alleged violations of the RRP Rule depicted on the home renovation television program, “Texas Flip N Move.” Under the terms of the settlement, the companies agreed to pay civil penalties of $30,000 and take steps to ensure compliance with the RRP Rule in future renovation projects. Further, the companies have agreed to complete projects to educate the public about lead-based paint hazards and the importance of using a certified renovator, including banners on existing episodes of “Texas Flip N Move,” developing informational webpages on their respective websites and adding links to the EPA Lead and RRP webpages, and integrating elements of the RRP Rule into future programing. Additionally, as part of the settlement, the companies will use a third-party entity to perform lead abatement in low-income pre-1978 housing residences or child-occupied facilities within the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Rickey Lynch (NY) is the first defendant charged with a felony violation of TSCA since the statute was amended in 2016 to include enhanced punishments for knowing and willful violations that pose an imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. As alleged, the defendant placed a very young child in imminent danger by deliberately disregarding federal standards that ensure the safe abatement of lead-based paint. The charges in the indictment are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. Actions $10,000 or More MIK Construction, Inc.

Worldwide, the company is the largest licensor of polyethylene and polypropylene technologies and the third largest independent chemical manufacturer. It also produces ethylene, propylene, polyolefins, and oxyfuels. The settlement involves the reduction of air pollution from petrochemical and chemical flares. A flare is a mechanical device, ordinarily elevated high off the ground, used to combust waste gases. Six facilities located in Channelview, Corpus Christi, and La Porte, Texas, as well as in Clinton, Iowa are covered in this settlement. The facilities subject to the settlement include two principal types of chemical plants: Olefins Plants. The primary products of these plants are ethylene and propylene, both of which are olefins. Ethylene is a feedstock for the production of consumer plastic products such as garbage bags, bread wrappers, packaging, and wire insulation. Propylene is also a feedstock used to produce products such as carpet, upholstery, boats, and car parts. Polymer Plants. The primary products of these plants are different grades of polyethylene, a polymer. Polyethylene is the feedstock for the production of consumer products such as food containers/packaging, carpet backing, diapers, pipe, truck bed liners, and shipping crates. Polyethylene is the most common plastic in the world. Pollutant Impacts Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs, along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Benzene - Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidences of leukemia have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene. EPA has classified benzene as a Group A human carcinogen. Greenhouse Gasses – Greenhouse Gases trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. This matter will result in the reduction of the following greenhouse gasses - carbon dioxide, ethane, and methane. The global warming potential of these gasses are normalized to the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. This metric is called carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Violations The complaint alleges violations of Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements at Lyondell’s flares that resulted in excess emissions of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) including benzene, and climate-change-causing greenhouse gases. The allegations include violations of: New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD) and Minor New Source Review, 40 C.F.R. Parts 51 and 52 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts A and DDD. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), 40 C.F.R.

Overview The DuPont Sabine facility is located at 3055 FM 1006, Orange, Orange County, Texas. DuPont was owner and operator of the Facility from 1946 through February 2019. On December 11, 2015, E.I du Pont De Nemours announced a merger with Dow Chemical Company, which closed on August 31, 2017. The combined company, DowDuPont, owned and operated the Facility from August 2017 through April 1, 2019. On April 1, 2019, Dow, Inc. (“Dow”) was spun off of DowDuPont, Inc. as a stand-alone publicly traded company. PMNA was a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont and was incorporated in Delaware in 2018. PMNA is the current owner and operator of the Facility through a Special Warranty Deed transfer of the Facility from DuPont to PMNA on or about February 1, 2019. Environmental Benefits The primary mechanism for pollution reduction in the proposed Decree is through the extensive injunctive relief under RCRA which provides for the investigation and subsequent cleanup of certain ditches and impoundments at the facility, if necessary, and the third-party audits under the CAA, CWA and RCRA. The Decree also includes RCRA corrective action obligations for the surface impoundments and ditches onsite to ensure cleanup of any soil, sediment or groundwater contamination, if identified through sampling. Violations This settlement resolves DuPont and PMNA's liability for alleged violations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), including failure to make a hazardous waste determination (30 Tex. Admin. Code § 335.62 and 40 C.F.R.§ 262.11); treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous wastes without a permit or interim status (42 U.S.C. § 6925 (a) and (e) and 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 335.43(a)); failure to perform land disposal determinations and to meet applicable treatment standards for hazardous waste disposal (Tex. Admin. Code § 335.431(c)(1) and 40 C.F.R. Part 268); and failure to provide financial assurance for closure, long-term care, and third-party liability (30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 37.6021, 335.179(b) and 335.128(a), and 40 C.F.R. §§ 264.143 and 265.143). Violations resolved under the Clean Water Act (CWA) include unauthorized discharges of process wastewater and treated domestic wastewater through Outfall 001 (33 U.S.C. § 1311(a), and Tex.

Overview XDP manufactures, markets, and sells aftermarket automotive products for diesel pickup trucks nationwide. XDP is headquartered in Wall Township, New Jersey, and has a sales and distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada. XDP conducts its business by selling to downstream distributors and retailers and also to individual customers through its website, https://www.xtremediesel.com/. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The Clean Air Act aims to reduce emissions from mobile sources of air pollution, including nitrogen oxides (NOx). Mobile sources of air pollution contribute approximately 58% of the nation’s NOx emissions. EPA testing demonstrates that installing aftermarket parts can result in increased NOx emissions from mobile sources. NOx emissions pose significant health and environmental concerns. NOx form when fuel burns at high temperatures. NOx can travel long distances, causing a variety of health and environmental problems in locations far from their emissions source, including ozone and smog. NOx also contribute to the formation of particulate matter (PM) through chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and PM can cause asthma, difficult or painful breathing, and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the elderly. It is also a major cause of substantial visibility impairment in many parts of the United States. The key health effects categories associated with ambient PM include premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma, and acute respiratory symptoms including aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis, and decreased lung function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and increased allergenicity have also been observed. Diesel exhaust PM is of special concern. The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely carcinogenic to humans. EPA estimates that this settlement will prevent the future sale of approximately 11,000 illegal products per year. EPA further estimates that the products XDP sold between January 2015 and May 2017 may result in more than 12 million pounds of excess NOx emissions and 115,000 pounds of excess PM emissions over the anticipated remaining life of the diesel pickup trucks equipped with XDP’s defeat devices. This enforcement action will prevent additional excess emissions that would have resulted from the continued sale of these illegal products. Violations XDP manufactured, sold, and/or offered to sell at least 27,000 aftermarket defeat devices designed for diesel pickup trucks between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2017. More specifically, XDP manufactured and sold products designed to disable or bypass exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems equipped on diesel pickup trucks. XDP also marketed and sold other EGR delete kits, empty exhaust pipes (a.k.a., “straight pipes”), and electronic tuning devices (“tuners”) that disable filters, catalysts, EGR systems, and other critical emissions control devices equipped on diesel pickup trucks. These emissions control devices were installed on motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines by original equipment manufacturers (i.e., truck manufacturers) in order to comply with Clean Air Act emission standards. XDP’s aftermarket products were designed for use with numerous models of vehicles, including diesel trucks manufactured by Ford, GM, and Dodge. Accordingly, the EPA alleges that each act of manufacturing and each sale constitutes a violation of Section 203(a)(3)(B) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. § 7522(a)(3)(B). Pollutant Impacts Today’s vehicles emit far less pollution than vehicles of the past. This is made possible by careful engine calibrations, and the use of filters and catalysts in the exhaust system. Aftermarket defeat devices undo this progress and pollute the air we breathe. The emissions impact depends on the original vehicle design and the extent of the vehicle modifications. EPA testing has shown that a vehicle’s emissions increase drastically (tens or hundreds of times, depending on the pollutant) when its emissions controls are removed. Here, XDP’s defeat devices enabled the removal of the EGR systems, filters, catalysts, and other emissions control systems that are necessary to treat air pollution formed in the engine before it is emitted into the ambient air.",1125000
20,"Gear Box Z, Inc., Clean Air Act Settlement"," (Washington, DC  – August 30, 2021) Today, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with Gear Box Z, Inc. (GBZ), to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA) associated with the manufacture, sale, and/or offer to sell aftermarket products that defeat the emissions control systems equipped on diesel pickup trucks. Nearly all of the products that GBZ manufactured and/or sold were illegal defeat devices. GBZ refused to stop manufacturing and selling these defeat devices, necessitating the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on January 3, 2020. The United States subsequently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on August 20, 2020, seeking to enjoin GBZ from selling any of its illegal products while the case was being litigated. After extensive briefing and an all-day evidentiary hearing held on February 17, 2021, the court granted the United States’ motion for a preliminary injunction on March 18, 2021. Today’s settlement halts the manufacture, sale, and installation of GBZ’s illegal products, prohibits GBZ and its owners from selling or transferring any intellectual property associated with these products, prohibits GBZ and its owners from providing technical support for these products, prohibits GBZ and its owners from investing in or obtaining revenue from defeat devices, and imposes substantial stipulated penalties if GBZ or its owners continue to manufacture or sell any aftermarket defeat devices in the future. In addition, the proposed consent decree also requires GBZ and its owners to pay a civil penalty of $10,000 over approximately three years due to its demonstrated financial inability to pay a higher penalty. This case resolution is part of the EPA’s National Compliance Initiative for the EPA, entitled Stopping Aftermarket Defeat Devices for Vehicles and Engines. EPA is vigorously pursuing enforcement against those who violate the defeat device and tampering prohibitions of the Clean Air Act.

The court enjoined GBZ from “(1) selling, offering for sale, or transferring any products or components listed in [an attachment to the Order], or any materially similar products; and (2) selling, offering for sale, or transferring any intellectual property associated with the products listed in [the attachment] to this Order, or any materially similar products.” In its opinion granting the request for a preliminary injunction, the court held: (1) that the United States was likely to prevail on the merits of the claims in its complaint that the manufacture and sale of the defeat devices violate Section 203(a)(3)(B) of the CAA, (2) that the continued selling of these defeat devices will result in irreparable harm, which the court called “obvious,” noting that such emissions of harmful pollutants damage human health and the environment; (3) that balancing the interest of the United States in preventing harm to human health and the environment against the financial interests of GBZ in this case tips in favor of human health and the environment; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest, since “Congress enacted the CAA to combat air pollution, which itself is a declaration of public policy.” The court also addressed an amicus curiae brief, filed on behalf of a trade association, which argued that the CAA’s prohibition on defeat devices does not apply to motor vehicles used for racing or competition purposes. The United States filed a response arguing that there is no competition motorsports “exclusion” in the CAA’s definition of “motor vehicle,” nor is there any “exemption” from the CAA’s defeat device prohibition for parts used on vehicles used in competition motorsports. The court held that any discussion of such an exclusion or exemption would be “entirely hypothetical,” and thus moot because “Defendant has not produced a single piece of evidence that a single one of its products has been used on a motor sports vehicle.” Similarly, the court dismissed GBZ’s claim that it is entitled to an exemption because its products are used for maintenance purposes. The court noted that no evidence on the record suggests that GBZ’s products are used for purposes of maintenance and repair. The court further observed that GBZ’s own statements and those of its customers show that the products are used for purposes other than maintenance and repair. Thus, the court held that there is no evidence that the purported maintenance exemption applies to GBZ’s products.

Injunctive Relief The Consent Decree contains provisions that halt the continued manufacture and sale of GBZ’s products. The provisions also apply to both GBZ and its owners, Jerry and James Black. The Consent Decree contains the following injunctive relief: Under the Consent Decree, GBZ must not manufacture, sell, offer to sell, or install in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine any of the products that were the subject of the court’s preliminary injunction order. The Consent Decree also requires GBZ to destroy subject products left in GBZ’s inventory. In addition, the Consent Decree requires GBZ to: cease technical support for the violative products; deny all warranty claims for the violative products; not sell or transfer any intellectual property associated with the violative products; and surrender all intellectual property to EPA, destroy any remaining intellectual property in their possession after surrender to EPA, and instruct any other persons or entities with possession of GBZ’s intellectual property to do the same. The Consent Decree also prohibits GBZ from possessing any ownership interest in any entity that GBZ knows, or with reasonable diligence should know, manufactures, sells, offers to sell, distributes, or installs any defeat devices, assist any entity with such activity, or earn any income from the distribution or installation of any defeat devices. Overview GBZ is a small company based in Colorado City, Arizona, that manufactured, marketed, and sold aftermarket automotive products for diesel pickup trucks nationwide. Prior to shutting down, GBZ sold its products to downstream distributors and retailers and also individual customers through its website. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The Clean Air Act aims to reduce emissions from mobile sources of air pollution, including nitrogen oxides (NOx). Mobile sources of air pollution contribute approximately 58% of the nation’s NOx emissions. EPA testing demonstrates that installing aftermarket parts can result in increased NOx emissions from mobile sources. NOx emissions pose significant health and environmental concerns. NOx form when fuel burns at high temperatures. NOx can travel long distances, causing a variety of health and environmental problems in locations far from their emissions source, including ozone and smog. NOx also contribute to the formation of particulate matter (PM) through chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and PM can cause asthma, difficult or painful breathing, and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the elderly. It is also a major cause of substantial visibility impairment in many parts of the United States. The key health effects categories associated with ambient PM include premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma, and acute respiratory symptoms including aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis, and decreased lung function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and increased allergenicity have also been observed. Diesel exhaust PM is of special concern. The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely carcinogenic to humans. EPA estimates that this settlement will prevent the future sale of approximately 3,600 illegal products per year. EPA further estimates that the products GBZ sold between January 2015 and April 2017 may result in more than 7.5 million pounds of excess NOx emissions and 170,000 pounds of excess PM emissions over the anticipated remaining life of the diesel pickup trucks equipped with GBZ’s defeat devices. This enforcement action will prevent additional excess emissions that would have resulted from the continued sale of these illegal products. Violations Between January 2015 and April 2017, GBZ manufactured, sold, and/or offered to sell at least 8,300 aftermarket defeat devices designed for diesel pickup trucks. GBZ sold thousands more until the court prohibited GBZ from continuing to sell its products in March 2021. The products GBZ manufactured and sold include electronic tuning devices (“tuners”) that disable filters, catalysts, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems, and other critical emissions control devices or alter engine performance. GBZ also manufactured and sold hardware products designed to disable or bypass EGR systems equipped on diesel pickup trucks and marketed and sold empty exhaust pipes (a.k.a., “straight pipes”) that enable removal of emissions controls. These emissions control devices were installed on motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines by original equipment manufacturers (i.e., truck manufacturers) in order to comply with Clean Air Act emission standards. GBZ’s aftermarket products were designed for use with numerous models of vehicles, including diesel trucks manufactured by Ford, GM, and Dodge. Accordingly, the EPA alleges that each act of manufacturing and each sale constitutes a violation of Section 203(a)(3)(B) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. § 7522(a)(3)(B). Pollutant Impacts Today’s vehicles emit far less pollution than vehicles of the past. This is made possible by careful engine calibrations, and the use of filters and catalysts in the exhaust system.

The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely carcinogenic to humans. EPA estimates that this settlement will prevent the future sale of approximately 12,000 illegal product units per year. On an annual basis, EPA projects this would result in the prevention of 830 tons of NOx, 8 tons of PM, 41 tons of non-methane hydrocarbons, and 263 tons of CO. Violations aFe manufactured, sold, and/or offered to sell at least 63,000 aftermarket defeat devices between 2014 and 2021. These products were for diesel and gas engines. All of the products were hardware exhaust system products -- sold individually or included in kits -- that physically alter or remove filters, catalysts and other critical emissions control devices that reduce air pollution. Emission control devices are installed on motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines by original equipment manufacturers (i.e., car manufacturers) in order to comply with Clean Air Act emission standards.

22,Settlement Resolves RCRA Violations and Requires Response Actions under Superfund," On June 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for District of Utah approved a settlement agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) with U.S. Magnesium (USM) to resolve violations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and require cleanup work under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly referred to as Superfund, at its facility in Rowley, Utah. The company committed to process changes at the facility to treat its waste streams in order to remove dioxins, furans, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). This will reduce environmental impacts from its operations and ensure greater protection for its workers. The company will also spend at least $37 million to clean up hazardous waste under the terms of the settlement. On this page: Information about U.S. Magnesium

In June 2002, over the objection of the United States, the Bankruptcy Court approved MagCorp’s request to sell the Rowley facility and substantially all of its other assets to USM, a Utah limited liability corporation newly-created by the Parent Entities for the purpose of retaining ownership of the facility. The Chapter 7 trustee was appointed to, in part, oversee the asset sales as a part of MagCorp’s bankruptcy and distribute the proceeds to creditors. In 2003, the same Chapter 7 trustee brought an action against MagCorp’s parent entities and others alleging, among other things, fraudulent conveyance, breach of fiduciary duty, payment of unlawful dividends, and corporate waste and mismanagement. The case was tried before a jury in February 2015 and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the trustee and a judgment in the amount of $214,697,948.44 in favor of the MagCorp bankruptcy estate. The judgment was affirmed in 2017 on appeal to the Second Circuit. Certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court in October 2017. In 2018, the United States and EPA entered into a bankruptcy settlement with MagCorp and Renco Metals bankruptcy trustee and other stakeholders resolving the distribution of the assets of the estates. EPA recovered over $23 million for CERCLA response cost claims.

The facility includes a sewage pond, a solid waste landfill, and waste piles for smut, barium sulfate and gypsum that are mixed with other hazardous constituents. Facility operations and waste disposal practices contaminated soil, air, surface water and groundwater. Although the area surrounding the facility is sparsely populated, investigations indicate uncontrolled waste on the property threatens the health of workers and the environment. RCRA hazardous wastes from the production of magnesium were mixed, stored, and disposed of with wastes excluded from RCRA regulation known as “Bevill wastes.” The resulting wastes were not properly characterized and were illegally discharged into an extensive network of earthen, open air ditches which conveyed other facility wastes away from process areas into an active 400 acre waste impoundment. EPA asserted that USM failed to properly identify RCRA hazardous wastes as those wastes are not Bevill excluded. USM violated sections 3004 and 3005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6924-25, and the applicable regulations in 40 C.F.R. Parts 260-270. Overview of the Settlement Agreement Along with the operational and process changes USM will make, the company will clean up contaminated soils, tanks, and sumps, decommission systems that are no longer in use, and construct a treatment/filtration plant to treat all of the wastewater before disposal. This work will significantly reduce the levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the ponds, which will be beneficial to birds and other animals. Under the Superfund provisions of the agreement, USM will construct a barrier wall around the active waste impoundment to prevent uncontrolled releases in the surrounding environment, which include adjacent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land and the Great Salt Lake. After cleanup work is completed, USM will assure the facility’s timely closure. The settlement includes financial assurance from USM, both for the ultimate closure of any new waste management units and for the ponds and other disposal units receiving commingled wastes. USM prepared a cost estimate that covered the cost of closure and post-closure. Financial assurance will cover the final closure plan and post-closure plan and retrofitted waste pond closure and post-closure. After manufacturing operations at the facility are concluded, USM will maintain the financial assurance for closure and post-closure of the retrofitted waste pond after EPA selects a cleanup plan for the facility and the Agency and USM reach agreement under a new settlement. EPA will also enter into an environmental covenant and a conditional mineral assignment pursuant to Utah law that will preserve the government’s ability to extract water and access to salt and mineral rights for the salt cap remedy in the event of a default. USM paid a civil penalty of $250,000. Information about U.S. Magnesium The Magnesium Corporation of America (“MagCorp”) was incorporated in 1993 and wholly owned by Renco Metals, Inc. (“Renco Metals”), a holding company with no independent operations of its own. Renco Metals was wholly owned by the Renco Group, Inc. (“Group”), another holding company, owned in turn by the Ira Leon Rennert Revocable Trusts (“Trusts”). Ira Rennert established the Trusts for the benefit of himself and members of his family. Rennert is the sole director of Renco Metals and the Chief Executive Officer of Group and Renco Metals. In 2002, USM was formed after MagCorp’s bankruptcy, through an asset sale supervised and approved by the Bankruptcy Court in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.",$23 million

Pursuant to its authority, the EPA amended the June 10, 2020 SSURO to expand the list of pesticides identified in Attachments to the Order to include additional pesticides that the EPA has reason to believe are being distributed or sold on eBay.com in violation of FIFRA. Accordingly, eBay is ordered to immediately stop the sale of unregistered and/or misbranded pesticides under its ownership, control, or custody, wherever such pesticide is offered for sale on eBay.com. Pursuant to the SSURO, eBay is also prohibited from using, selling, offering for sale, holding for sale, shipping, or delivering for shipment the subject pesticides for any reason. The SSURO shall remain in effect unless and until revoked, terminated, suspended, or modified in writing by the EPA. For more information on the use of stop sale, use, or removal orders. Overview eBay is a global corporation headquartered in San Jose, California that operates and controls the interactive e-commerce website eBay.com. The June 10, 2020 SSURO to eBay is amended to address an additional 170 pesticides that are unlawfully held for sale, offered for sale, and sold on eBay’s website. Among other unlawful pesticide products, products in the amendment include: dichlorvos (DDVP), an organophosphate insecticide that has various restrictions and prohibited uses in the United States due to the dangers it presents to human health; pesticides containing brodifacoum which is an especially hazardous anticoagulant poison linked to several cases of human intoxication; and pesticides making unapproved claims to control the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA or “the Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 136-136y, and its regulations, are the primary Federal laws governing the production, sale, distribution, and use of pesticides in the United States. With certain exceptions, no person can sell or distribute a pesticide in the United States that is not registered with the EPA. Further, no person may distribute or sell a pesticide that is misbranded; a product is misbranded when its labeling bears any statement, design, or graphic representation relative thereto or to its ingredients which is false or misleading in any particular. Additionally, no person selling or distributing a FIFRA-regulated pesticide may claim that the pesticide is effective against any microbiological organism including bacteria, fungi, or viruses, unless that pesticide is registered with the EPA and that particular efficacy claim has been deemed acceptable by the Agency. The EPA is tasked with enforcing FIFRA to minimize risks to human health and the environment associated with the distribution and use of pesticides in the United States. Basis for the Amended Order Beginning in December 2020, the EPA began reviewing information from tips and complaints from consumers and industry stakeholders of pesticides offered for sale on eBay.com in violation of FIFRA. Subsequently, the EPA began collecting and reviewing additional information on product sales and inspecting offers for sale on eBay.com. Based on the information collected, the EPA has reason to believe that eBay has been distributing or selling, and intends to continue distributing or selling, pesticides that are unregistered and/or misbranded in violation of sections 12(a)(1)(A), (E) of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 136j(a)(1)(A), (E).",No Claimable Amount

Overview United Parcel Service, Inc., (UPS) is an American multinational shipping and receiving company and is one of the world’s largest shipping couriers. UPS is known for air and ground shipping services and operates 161 facilities in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. TForce Freight Inc., formerly known as UPS Ground Freight, operates a freight distribution and transportation operation at 22 facilities across the five States in Region 6. Some Facilities are large hubs that accommodate over the road semi-trucks and trailers and/or air freight, which are then sorted and redistributed categorically to smaller hubs for packages to make their way to designated destinations. The Facilities may generate hazardous waste when a package is damaged, as well as a result of day-to-day operations, like automotive maintenance. Environmental Benefits Through the training of UPS employees and better networking with the hazardous waste vendor(s), Respondents will have a better knowledge of the types and quantity of hazardous waste they generate, and with workable SOPs in place, there will be better handling and management of hazardous waste by Respondents. The correct knowledge of the type and quantity of hazardous waste and the better handling and management of the hazardous wastes will result in fewer potential releases to the environment and the protection of employees’ health and safety. Violations Respondents’ Facilities generate hazardous waste regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The claims in the Consent Agreement and Final Order (CAFO) alleged that Respondents: Pollutant Impacts UPS Facilities may generate hazardous waste when a package is damaged, as well as during day-to-day operations such as maintenance. Without proper waste determinations and trained employees, many hazardous wastes may be disposed of in dumpsters or other municipal waste collection receptacles and deposited in the incorrect type of landfill. Hazardous wastes destined for land disposal must abide by the land disposal restrictions and other relevant areas of RCRA. Of the 183 facilities covered by this settlement, many were found to be operating within communities EPA identifies as disproportionately impacted by pollution. Pollutants potentially released and improperly managed included both large and small quantities of non-acute hazardous wastes and acute hazardous wastes.","3,800,000"

Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. For More Information, Contact: Sheldon Muller, Senior Assistant Regional Counsel U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8 1595 Wynkoop Street (8ORC-LE-R) Denver, CO 80202 (303) 312-6916muller.sheldon@epa.gov Monica Heimdal, Environmental Engineer U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8 1595 Wynkoop Street (8ENF-W-NW) Denver, CO 80202 (303) 312-6359heimdal.monica@epa.gove Kenneth M. Champagne, Environmental Scientist U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8 10 West 15th Street, Suite 3200 (8SEM-RC) Helena, Montana 59626 (406) 457-5025champagne.kenneth@epa.gov Injunctive Relief This proposed settlement will repair important environmental resources damaged by Defendants. The proposed Consent Decree requires Defendants to restore approximately 1.5 miles of Vermillion Creek and the 8.47 acres of wetlands impacted adjacent to the creek. Defendants will construct a stream channel with a length and sinuosity approximately equal to that of the pre-disturbance channel. The pre-disturbance alignment and full channel length of Vermillion Creek on BLM land will be restored. On private property, the restored channel will be returned to the pre-disturbance alignment with minor modifications to avoid hillslope areas. Additional channel length will be provided on private property to offset the length reduction associated with these modifications. The restoration work required by the proposed Consent Decree is intended to re-establish 9.51 acres of wetlands adjacent to the restored Vermillion Creek and rehabilitate 0.21 acre and establish 0.22 acre of wetlands along a downstream reach of the post-disturbance channel. The extra acreage will ensure that Defendants achieve a minimum of 8.47 acres of sustainable wetlands at the end of the proposed Consent Decree’s monitoring period. If, however, 8.47 acres of wetlands have not survived at the end of the monitoring period, the proposed Consent Decree identifies potential contingency areas to ensure that Defendants meet the 8.47 acres requirement. The proposed Consent Decree also requires Defendants to place a deed restriction on their property to protect the restored Vermillion Creek and its adjacent wetlands in perpetuity. Additionally, the proposed Consent Decree requires Defendants to remove the bridge they constructed over Vermillion Creek and to replace the cottonwood trees they destroyed on BLM land. Overview Mr. Raftopoulos runs Diamond Peak Cattle Company, LLC and Rancho Greco Limited, LLC. These operations encompass some 55,000 acres of deeded land and another 250,000 to 300,000 acres of BLM and state and private leases. Diamond Peak Cattle Company, LLC is one of the largest ranching operations in Colorado. Civil Penalties, Damages, and Costs For their alleged CWA violations, Defendants will pay a civil penalty of $265,000 within 30 days of the effective date of the Consent Decree. For their alleged FLPMA violations, Defendants will pay damages of $78,194 within 30 days of the effective date of the Consent Decree. Defendants will also pay up to $20,000 in future administrative costs incurred by BLM related to restoration oversight within 30 days after receipt of BLM’s documentation and certification of these costs. Violations On October 22, 2020, the United States filed suit in federal district court alleging that beginning in approximately 2012, and as recently as approximately 2015, Defendants discharged dredged or fill material into Vermillion Creek and its adjacent wetlands in order to route the creek into a new channel, facilitate agricultural activities and construct a bridge. These alleged unauthorized activities occurred on private land owned by Defendants and on public land managed by BLM, constituting a trespass in violation of FLPMA. Vermillion Creek and its adjacent wetlands are waters of the United States and may not be filled without a CWA Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), which was not obtained. EPA develops and interprets the policy, guidance and environmental criteria the Corps uses in evaluating permit applications. The United States’ lawsuit further contended that Defendants’ alleged trespass also included unauthorized irrigation, removal of minerals and destruction of numerous cottonwood trees on federal public land. The fill and related activities on BLM lands were conducted without BLM authorization. Defendants’ trespass actions not only interfered with the public’s right to current enjoyment of federal public lands, but also jeopardized the future health and maintenance of these lands for use by all. Pollutant Impacts The portions of Vermillion Creek and its adjacent wetlands impacted by Defendants’ unauthorized activities provided aquatic and wildlife habitat, runoff conveyance and groundwater recharge. The straightening of Vermillion Creek contributed to erosion of the bed and banks of the stream and detrimental sediment deposition downstream of the channelization. Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge, which provides important habitat for the endangered Colorado pikeminnow, is located at the confluence of Vermillion Creek and the Green River, approximately one mile downstream from the impacted area. Similarly, the destruction of numerous cottonwood trees located adjacent to the creek eliminated nesting, perching, and roosting habitat for raptor species, including bald eagle, golden eagle and red-tailed hawk. Cottonwood galleries with riparian vegetation also provide nesting habitat for a variety of migratory birds.","265,000 + 78,194 + 20,000 = 363,194"

Overview of Company The owners and/or operators of the four plants subject to this settlement are The Dow Chemical Company and its subsidiaries, Performance Materials NA, Inc, and Union Carbide Corporation (collectively “Dow”). The Dow Chemical Company is a publicly traded company headquartered in Midland, Michigan. The settlement involves the reduction of air pollution from petrochemical and chemical flares. A flare is a mechanical device, ordinarily elevated high off the ground, used to combust waste gases. The State of Louisiana joined the settlement as a co-plaintiff with the United States. The settlement covers 26 Dow flares at four facilities located in: Freeport, Texas; Hahnville, Louisiana; Orange, Texas; and Plaquemine, Louisiana. The four facilities include two principle types of chemical plants: Olefins Plants. The primary products of these plants are ethylene and propylene, both of which are olefins. Ethylene is a feedstock for the production of consumer plastic products such as garbage bags, bread wrappers, packaging, and wire insulation. Propylene is also a feedstock used to produce products such as carpet, upholstery, boats, and car parts. Polymer Plants. The primary products of these plants are different grades of polyethylene, a polymer. Polyethylene is the feedstock for the production of consumer products such as food containers/packaging, carpet backing, diapers, pipe, truck bed liners, and shipping crates. Polyethylene is the most common plastic in the world. Pollutant Impacts Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs, along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Benzene - Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidences of leukemia have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene. EPA has classified benzene as a Group A human carcinogen. Particulate Matter – PM, especially fine particles, contain microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. PM is linked to a variety of problems, including increased respiratory symptoms such as irritation of the airways, coughing, or difficulty breathing, decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease. Violations The complaint alleges violations of Clean Air Act requirements at Dow’s flares that resulted in excess emissions of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) including benzene. The allegations include violations of: New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD) and Minor New Source Review, 40 C.F.R. Parts 51 and 52 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts A, Kb, DDD and NNN. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), 40 C.F.R.

Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Washington, DC 20460tozzi.lauren@epa.gov Civil Penalty Under the settlement, Toyota will pay a civil penalty of $180 million. Injunctive Relief The settlement requires Toyota to comply with the regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 85 Subpart T (“Emission Defect Reporting Requirements”). Toyota must also initiate an internal investigation of potential defects under certain conditions (i.e., 1% or 500 unscreened warranty claims concerning a particular emission-related component, or 25 reports from service technicians at Toyota dealers concerning a particular emission-related component). Further, Toyota will provide EPA with supplemental reporting on its internal investigations and its recalls. This supplemental reporting will provide transparency that will help facilitate EPA oversight. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Air pollution emitted from transportation contributes to smog, and to poor air quality, which has negative impacts on the health and welfare of U.S. citizens. Pollutants that contribute to poor air quality include particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Violations From approximately 2005 to 2015, Toyota circumvented EPA oversight provisions under the Clean Air Act and avoided or delayed recalls of defective emission control systems by systematically failing to submit reports to EPA of defects to emission related parts and corresponding recalls. Toyota materially delayed reporting an estimated 78 defects to EPA, reporting some defects years later than the law requires. All told, Toyota was late in filing hundreds of mandatory reports related to emission-related defects and recalls. Toyota’s failures constituted violations of section 203(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7522(a)(2). Even if properly designed and certified, motor vehicles may fail to perform as designed because of a defect. The defect may be, for example, a design or manufacturing error, a malfunctioning part, or an error in the software that controls vehicle functions. If the defect affects one of the many vehicle components designed to control emissions, the vehicle may, in actual use, emit more air pollution. Clean Air Act regulations require light-duty motor vehicle manufacturers to notify EPA when 25 or more vehicles in a given model year have the same defect in an emission-related part. Manufacturers must also report to EPA when they perform a recall to correct defects in emission-related parts, and update EPA on the progress of such recalls. These mandatory reporting requirements are central to the Clean Air Act’s purpose of protecting human health and the environment from harmful air pollution. They encourage manufacturers to investigate and voluntarily address defects that may result in excess emissions, and they provide EPA information regarding emission-related defects for the agency to use in its oversight of manufacturers’ compliance. As a result of its conduct, Toyota deprived EPA of timely information regarding emission defects and recalls and avoided the early oversight on emission defects contemplated by the regulations. In its oversight role, EPA may investigate defects, influence manufacturers to conduct a voluntary recall, or order a mandatory recall. Toyota’s conduct likely resulted in delayed or avoided recalls, lengthening the time that unrepaired vehicles with emission defects remained on the road.",180 million
30,Home Depot Settlement," (Washington, DC - April 23, 2021)  – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice today announced a nationwide settlement with Home Depot U.S.A.

Settlement Resources Press Release Consent Decree Questions and Answers Injunctive Relief Under the settlement, Home Depot will implement a company-wide program to ensure that the firms and contractors it hires to perform work for its customers comply with the EPA’s Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP) Rule during renovations of any child-occupied facilities, such as day-care centers and pre-schools and any housing that was built before 1978. To do this, Home Depot has developed an electronic compliance system to verify that the contractors it hires are properly certified and, if not, removed from the hiring system. Home Depot also will require its contractors to use a detailed checklist to document compliance. The checklist will lead the contactors through the steps required for RRP Rule compliance. Home Depot will include penalty provisions in its contracts with contractors to ensure that they comply with RRP regulations. Home Depot will also conduct thousands of on-site inspections of work being performed by contractors to ensure they comply with lead-safe work practices. Home Depot will add a link on its website to EPA’s content on lead-safe work practices and use a company-wide system to actively track the RRP firm and renovator certifications of its contractors. In addition, Home Depot will take action to respond to situations where a contractor is not operating in compliance with the RRP Rule, investigate all reports of potential noncompliance, and ensure that any violations are corrected and reported to EPA. Home Depot will provide important information in its stores, on its website, on YouTube, and in workshops, to its professional and do-it-yourself customers about the importance of using lead-safe work practices. The RRP Rule does not apply to do-it-yourself projects in your own home. However, the EPA recommends using the Rule’s lead-safe work practices in your own home projects, so this important information will help families learn how to protect themselves, and their children, by safely performing home improvement projects. For more information, contact: Amos Presler Chemical Risk and Reporting Enforcement Branch U.S. EPA, OECA, Office of Civil Enforcement (202) 564-1076presler.amos@epa.gov Overview of Company Home Depot U.S.A. Inc. is a subsidiary of The Home Depot, Inc., with offices in Atlanta, Georgia. At over 2,000 Home Depot stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), customers purchase a home improvement product—like flooring, carpet, cabinets, countertops, or windows—and contract with Home Depot for installation. Home Depot has a network of local contractors that it hires to complete projects in thousands of homes every day. Civil Penalty Home Depot will pay a $20.75 million penalty. Of that amount, $750,000 will be paid as a penalty to the State of Utah, $732,000 will be paid as a penalty to Massachusetts, and $50,000 will be paid to the State of Rhode Island. Concerned About a Renovation in Your Home? Home Depot customers with questions or complaints about the handling of lead paint during their Home Depot renovations should contact Home Depot at lead_paint@homedepot.com. Any member of the public concerned about handling lead-based paint in their home can contact the National Lead Information Center at 1 (800) 424-LEAD. Anyone who suspects a violation of the EPA’s Lead RRP Rule by any company doing work in their home can report that violation through the EPA’s Tip and Complaint webpage at https://echo.epa.gov/report-environmental-violations. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Lead dust and paint chips can occur when lead paint deteriorates or is disrupted during home renovation and remodeling activities. Lead exposure can cause a range of health problems, from behavioral disorders and learning disabilities to seizures and death, putting young children at the greatest risk because their nervous systems are still developing. EPA enforces the RRP Rule and other lead rules to protect children and others who are vulnerable to exposure to lead dust that can cause lead poisoning. A blood lead test is the only way to determine if a child has a high lead level. Parents who think their child has been in contact with lead dust should contact their child's health care provider. Renovation firms that are certified under EPA’s RRP Rule are encouraged to display EPA’s “Lead-Safe” logo on workers’ uniforms, signs, websites and other material, as appropriate. Consumers can protect themselves by looking for the logo before hiring a renovation firm. Consumers can learn more about the RRP Rule and hiring a certified firm by calling the National Lead Information Center at 1-(800)-424-LEAD or visiting www.epa.gov/lead. Violations EPA discovered the alleged violations through customer complaints about projects performed in Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin which showed Home Depot frequently subcontracted work to uncertified firms, did not use lead-safe work practices, did not perform required post-renovation cleaning, did not provide the EPA-required lead-based paint pamphlets to occupants, and did not establish records of compliance. EPA then conducted a comprehensive review of Home Depot’s records from projects performed by the company’s renovation contractors throughout the United States. The government alleged that Home Depot sent uncertified firms to perform projects required to be performed by certified and trained firms. In addition, Home Depot failed to establish, retain, or provide compliance documentation showing that specific contractors had been certified by EPA, had been properly trained, and had used lead-safe work practices in projects performed in homes. Pollutant Impacts Lead-based paint was banned in 1978 but still remains in many homes and apartments across the country. According to HUD’s American Healthy Homes Survey, which was conducted from June 2005 through March 2006, an estimated 37.1 million homes – or 34.9 percent of all homes nationwide - have lead-based paint somewhere in the building. An estimated 34.4 million of these homes were built before 1978. The likelihood that a home has lead-based paint increases with the age of the property. The EPA estimates that lead-based paint is present in 24% of homes built between 1960-1977, 69% of homes built 1940-1959, and 87% of homes built before 1940.",20.75 million

The settlement also includes a key requirement that the City restore the pollution reduction capacity of its storm sewer system that was lost when the City failed to require developers to install permanent stormwater management structures at large residential developments and when it failed to require that such structures be properly built and maintained when they were installed. The City will meet this requirement by inspecting existing structures to ensure they are working properly, by installing new stormwater management structures, and by upgrading existing stormwater management structures to increase the ability of those structures to capture and remove stormwater pollution. Finally, the settlement requires the City to mitigate the damage caused to Fountain Creek and its tributaries by paying for a study to determine where those streams have been most impacted by stormwater pollution and what can be done to improve water quality. The City will then propose stream restoration projects for review and approval by the plaintiffs based on the recommendations in the study. These projects could include habitat restoration, channel restoration, constructed wetlands and similar projects intended to attenuate stormwater pollutants entering Fountain Creek or its tributaries. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at Department of Justice. Contact Laurianne M.

In lieu of paying a civil penalty to the State, the City will perform State-approved supplemental environmental projects valued at $1 million that will improve water quality in the Arkansas River, into which Fountain Creek flows south of the City. Overview of Company The Defendant, Colorado Springs, is a city of approximately 460,000 people in central Colorado, about 70 miles south of Denver. The alleged violations relate to the City’s mismanagement of its storm sewer system since 2002. Colorado Springs’ storm sewer system covers an area of almost 200 square miles and consists of 389 miles of storm sewer mains; 118 miles of privately owned sewer lines; 250 miles of ditches/channels; 13,243 inlets; 1,459 manholes; 72 ponds; 693 major outfalls; and 1,316 minor outfalls. The storm sewer discharges to Fountain Creek and several of its tributaries. Fountain Creek flows north to south, bisecting Colorado Springs and eventually flowing into the Arkansas River near Pueblo, Colorado, which is about 40 miles south of Colorado Springs. Major tributaries of Fountain Creek in Colorado Springs include Monument Creek, Camp Creek, Cheyenne Creek, Shooks Run, Sand Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Pine Creek. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The improvements made by the City under this settlement will result in significant reductions in the discharge of pollutants, such as sediment, oil and grease, heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers, and bacteria, into Fountain Creek and its tributaries in Colorado Springs. Communities downstream of Colorado Springs will also see significant water quality improvements from the settlement. This settlement will protect these waters as sources of recreation, irrigation and drinking water for many years to come. Violations The City’s stormwater management program must comply with the Clean Water Act and applicable regulations, as well as the equivalent State of Colorado water act and regulations. In addition, the City’s stormwater management program is governed by the conditions and limitations in its discharge permit issued by the State. The requirements in the applicable laws and the City’s discharge permit are intended to reduce pollution in stormwater to the maximum extent practical through specific measures such as permanent structural controls at sources that discharge stormwater into the storm sewer system, including municipal operations, active construction sites, new residential and commercial real estate developments, and industrial sites. The EPA and the State conducted inspections of the City’s stormwater management program in 2013 and again in 2015. Based on these inspections as well as a follow up investigation, the EPA and the State determined that there were widespread violations of the City’s discharge permit resulting in discharges of pollutants into Fountain Creek and its tributaries in Colorado Springs in violation of the Clean Water Act and other applicable laws. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, and the State of Colorado alleged claims against the City of Colorado Springs in an amended complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on January 26, 2017. The complaint generally alleged that the City of Colorado Springs failed to adequately fund its stormwater management program and allowed storm sewers and City facilities intended to prevent stormwater pollution, such as regional stormwater detention ponds, to fall into disrepair. The complaint also alleged that the City failed to require developers to install permanent stormwater management structures, such as extended detention basins, at large residential developments and failed to ensure these structures were properly built and maintained when they were installed. Finally, the complaint alleged that the City failed to enforce requirements that construction site operators implement appropriate measures to prevent polluted stormwater from running off active construction sites. Pollutant Impacts Water quality and the aquatic and riparian habitats in and near Fountain Creek and its tributaries have been in decline for several decades. The most significant water quality problems resulting from the City’s mismanagement of its storm sewer system appear to be sedimentation, E. coli, and scouring of riverbeds and banks. Sediment from stormwater is the most common pollutant in rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs. Sediment from stormwater can degrads the quality of water for drinking, wildlife, and the aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Cloudy water from sediment can block sunlight needed by natural vegetation and make it harder for fish and other animals that hunt in the water to see their prey. In addition, sediment can smother smaller aquatic organisms, as well as eggs and larvae of fish and other naturally occuring animals. E. coli is a bacterium whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term effects for people, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, and people with severely compromised immune systems. Microbes in these wastes may also adversely affect the native aquatic animals in streams, rivers, and lakes, as well as animals that use these waters for drinking and food. Both Fountain Creek and its largest tributary, Monument Creek, are listed by the State of Colorado Springs as impaired for E. coli.",1000000
33,"Valero Energy Corporation, et al. Clean Air Act Settlement"," (Washington, D.C. – October 19, 2020) The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement today with Valero Energy Corporation and a number of its subsidiaries and affiliates (Valero). The settlement resolves alleged Clean Air Act (CAA) violations regarding fuel quality standards and sampling, testing, and reporting requirements at 11 refineries and one import facility. Under the terms of the settlement, Valero will develop and implement a company-wide Fuels Management System (FMS) to help ensure its production of gasoline and diesel fuel complies with the CAA and its implementing regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 80 (Fuels Regulations), implement a mitigation action to offset past emissions, and pay a $2.85 million civil penalty to the United States. Valero separately committed to completing two benzene reduction measures at its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas that Valero estimates will result in emission reductions of 583 pounds per year and will cost the company $1.775 million to implement.

Specifically, Valero will install geodesic domes on three gasoline storage tanks at its El Vista Terminal near the Port Arthur Refinery. The El Vista Terminal is located near an environmental justice community. Valero estimates that installation of the geodesic domes will result in VOC emissions reductions of 23 tons per year and will cost $3 million. Civil Penalty Valero will pay a civil penalty of $2.85 million Overview of Company Valero owns a diversified business portfolio in refining, marketing, and natural gas-related services. Valero has a refining throughput capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day. Violations This settlement resolves an EPA enforcement action against Valero for violations of the CAA and the Fuels Regulations involving its failure to comply with certain fuel quality standards and various sampling, testing, and reporting requirements at its refineries and import facilities located in Norco, Louisiana (St. Charles Refinery), Port Arthur, Texas (Port Arthur Refinery), Texas City, Texas (Texas City Refinery), Houston, Texas (Houston Refinery and KMI Houston Terminal), Sunray, Texas (McKee Refinery), Corpus Christ, Texas (Corpus Christi East Refinery), Memphis, Tennessee (Memphis Refinery), Perth Amboy, New Jersey (KMI Perth Amboy NJ Terminal), West Memphis, Arkansas (West Memphis Terminal), Hammond, Indiana (Hammond Terminal), and Queensbury, New York (Ultramar Energy). The EPA discovered the alleged violations during a 2015 compliance evaluation of Valero and from information self-disclosed by Valero. The fuel quality violations involve Valero’s: Pollutant Impacts The EPA estimates that Valero’s fuel quality standards violations resulted in about 29 excess tons of VOC emissions, including toxics such as benzene. Air toxics— also known as “hazardous air pollutants”— are those pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health or environmental effects. VOCs are one of the primary causes of ground level ozone. Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion, and can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Increased sulfur levels in gasoline reduces the ability of the catalyst to reduce nitrogen oxides and VOCs. Valero also violated various sampling, testing, and reporting requirements. These programmatic requirements serve as the foundation of the EPA’s fuels programs. When companies do not comply with these requirements, they increase the likelihood that fuel fails to meet the fuel quality standards. Opportunity Zones The KMI Perth Amboy NJ Terminal, Texas City Refinery, and West Memphis Terminal are three facilities affected by this settlement that are located within an Opportunity Zone.",0
34,EPA and Electrolux Reach Settlement for Illegal Imports of Air Filter Products Incorporating Nanosilver," The U.S. EPA has entered a settlement agreement with Electrolux Home Products, Inc. (Electrolux), to resolve liabilities under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). As part of the agreement, memorialized in a Consent Agreement and Final Order (CAFO), Electrolux will pay a civil penalty in the amount of $6,991,400. On this page:",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/epa-and-electrolux-reach-settlement-illegal-imports-air-filter-products-incorporating,Consent Agreement and Final Order,2020-10-15,"Settlement Resources Press Release Consent Agreement and Final Order Overview Violations Health and Environmental Impacts Contact For more information, contact: Adrienne Trivedi Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance U.S. EPA Headquarters William Jefferson Clinton Building 1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW Mail Code 2249A Washington, DC 20460 (202) 564-7862trivedi.adrienne@epa.gov Health and Environmental Impacts The sale and distribution of unregistered pesticides may pose risks to human health and the environment. The only nanosilver pesticides that are currently registered with the EPA are approved solely for incorporation into textiles to protect those articles themselves from antimicrobial pests such as mold and bacteria that can cause deterioration, discoloration or odors. No nanosilver pesticide, or nanosilver-incorporating pesticide product, is registered with the EPA for use in home appliances to disinfect the ambient air or protect the health of the consumer. The EPA has not assessed the risks of exposure to humans from nanosilver being incorporated into a consumer air filter. Upon determining that the air filter products were unregistered pesticides, the EPA coordinated closely with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection across ports and EPA regions to prevent them from entering U.S. commerce. After Electrolux committed to removing the filters with the unregistered nanosilver, both agencies worked together to conditionally release all the shipments held nationwide so that Electrolux could consolidate them, under EPA administrative order, at several of its own facilities. Electrolux then systematically replaced the filters manufactured with nanosilver and removed the online and on-box pesticidal claims for not only the products it had imported, but for some additional products already in the U.S. As of the date of the settlement, Electrolux has returned over 500,000 air conditioners and dehumidifiers to compliance for lawful sale in the United States. Overview The CAFO resolves Electrolux’s liabilities under section 12(a)(1)(A) of FIFRA for 573 unlawful distributions, by import, of unregistered pesticides, and its liabilities under section 12(a)(2)(N) of FIFRA for its failure to file the required Notice of Arrival of Pesticides and Devices (NOAs) upon the import of those products on 141 occasions. The imports at issue occurred between January 11, 2020, and May 12, 2020, and were made through eleven different U.S. ports of entry across six EPA Regions. The products that Electrolux imported were approximately 420,000 Frigidaire brand dehumidifiers and air conditioners that contained filters incorporating an unregistered nanosilver pesticide and which were labeled and marketed with pesticidal claims. The claims included “antibacterial filter,” and “helps eliminate bacteria in the air that can make breathing difficult.” The incorporation of nanosilver for an antibacterial purpose renders the dehumidifier and air conditioner products pesticides under FIFRA. Electrolux, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, designs, manufactures, sells and distributes home appliances and other products for kitchen, laundry and other uses. It is a subsidiary of AB Electrolux, based in Stockholm, Sweden. Violations Because the dehumidifier and air conditioner products were not registered with the EPA, their import was unlawful. Sections 3(a) and 12(a)(1)(A) of FIFRA prohibit the sale or distribution, including import, of unregistered pesticides in the United States. Because Electrolux failed to file NOAs for 141 of the imported shipments, it is in violation of section 12(a)(2)(N) of FIFRA. The EPA is authorized to seek the assessment of civil penalties for such liabilities under section 14(a) of FIFRA.",0

The facility is one of Louisiana’s oldest commercial horse racetracks and is located in an area surrounded by residential neighborhoods. The facility is a large concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) because it stables or confines more than 500 horses for at least 45 days a year. During a typical horse racing season, Fair Grounds stables as many as 1,800 horses or more at one time. The facility includes a 38.8-acre production area that includes stables, horse stall barns and receiving barns, horse wash racks, horse walkways, horse walkers, manure storage areas, and storage areas for raw materials. The facility also includes a one-mile dirt racetrack and a 7/8-mile turf racetrack, the infield area, the grandstand, the casino, and associated parking areas. Fair Grounds was purchased by Churchill Downs, Inc. (CDI) in 2004. CDI is a Kentucky entity that operates a number of racetracks, casinos, and other gaming and entertainment entities in eleven states. Civil Penalty Fair Grounds will be required to pay a civil penalty of $2,790,000 within 30 days of the effective date of the CD. Violations The United States’ complaint alleges that Fair Grounds violated the Clean Water Act (CWA), including the terms and conditions of its Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (LPDES) permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of the CWA. Specifically, the complaint alleges that, since at least 2012, Fair Grounds has regularly discharged untreated process wastewater into the New Orleans municipal separate storm sewer system (including the London Avenue Canal that is used for fishing), which then leads to Lake Pontchartrain, the Mississippi River, and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico. Fair Grounds is permitted to discharge into the storm sewer system in significant rain events (i.e., when 10 inches of rain falls in 24 hours). However, unauthorized discharges have occurred during rain events as small as a half-inch of rain falling over 24 hours, as well as in dry weather, and would have continued to occur without this settlement. The complaint alleges that unauthorized discharges of horse wash water and other contaminated wastewater occurred more than 250 times between 2012 and 2018. The untreated process wastewater from the facility contains manure, urine, horse wash water, and other biological materials that are “pollutants” as defined by the CWA, the facility’s permit, and the applicable EPA and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regulations. The complaint also alleges that Fair Grounds violated several other permit conditions, such as failure to comply with its Nutrient Management Plan, failure to submit discharge monitoring reports on time, failure to report discharges in annual reports, and failure to include all appropriate monitoring and reporting data for fecal coliform in quarterly reports. In addition, this case is part of EPA’s National Compliance Initiative for Reducing Significant Noncompliance with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permits. Pollutant Impacts Pollutants associated with the discharges from this facility include nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), pathogens (bacteria), and organic enrichment (low dissolved oxygen), all of which contribute to water quality impairment in U.S. waters. Other potential environmental and human health risks include transmission of disease-causing bacteria and parasites associated with food and waterborne diseases, fish advisories, and algal blooms.","2790,000"

Civil Penalty The City of Corpus Christi will pay a civil penalty of $1,136,000 which will be split equally between the United States and the State of Texas. Injunctive Relief The proposed settlement includes specific requirements to address WWTP exceedances of permitted pollutant limits and SSOs, unintentional discharges of raw sewage from municipal sanitary sewers. The City will conduct a comprehensive assessment of its sanitary sewer system to identify defective sewer pipes and lift stations in poor condition. The assessment results will be used to prioritize rehabilitation efforts aimed to prevent the occurrence of future SSOs. During the first four years of implementation of this settlement, the City will focus its efforts on assessing and rehabilitating portions of the city that have historically experienced SSOs, covering roughly 450 miles of sewer. The City will conduct a system-wide capacity assessment and address areas where SSOs have occurred or are predicted to occur, especially during large rain events. The City of Corpus Christi will implement a capacity, management, operation, and maintenance program which includes comprehensive system cleaning and a grease control program to minimize SSOs caused by sewer blockages. The program also includes measures the City will take to quickly respond to and clean up further sewage releases. The total cost of implementing these measures is estimated to be approximately $600 million over the 15-year period to complete the injunctive relief. Overview of Sewer Authority and Facilities The city of Corpus Christi (the City) owns and operates one of the largest separate sewer systems in Texas, consisting of 6 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a wastewater collection system with more than 1,250 miles of sewer pipe and 100 lift stations Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Total Suspended Solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients – Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive Violations The United States alleges that the city of Corpus Christi violated Section 301 of the Clean Water Act and terms and conditions of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, which set limits for how much of a certain pollutant an entity is allowed to discharge into a waterbody. The City’s alleged violations include effluent limit exceedances, frequent discharges of raw sewage to waters of the United States and failure to prevent sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) through proper operation and maintenance of its system.","$1,136,000"
37,Agreement Establishes Long-Term Stewardship Requirements at RCRA Facility in Illinois," On September 22, 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and US Ecology agreed to an administrative order on consent (AOC) under Section 3008(h) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to ensure long-term stewardship (LTS) activities continue at the US Ecology’s facility in Sheffield, Illinois. The LTS plan provided for in the agreement includes maintenance of the engineered controls, semi-annual groundwater and surface water sampling, 5-Year Remedy Reviews with separate sampling requirements, statistical trend evaluations of the data, annual certification of institutional controls, a contingency plan, and financial assurance. This new AOC provides EPA an enforceable mechanism to ensure LTS activities continue to protect human health and the environment in perpetuity at a facility where hazardous waste is contained. As this facility approaches its 30-year monitoring obligation under the state post-closure permit, and all other RCRA Corrective Action obligations are met, this AOC provides for all future requirements. This ensures proper oversight and eliminates the duplication of both an EPA AOC and an Illinois EPA (IEPA) permit, which is still in effect but defers entirely to the EPA’s AOC.

Daimler must install an AEM in at least 85% of the U.S. passenger car vehicle fleet (“National Passenger Car Emission Modification Program (EMP) Rate”) by two years from the Effective Date of the CD or two years from approval of the last-submitted passenger vehicle EMC, whichever is later. Daimler must install the AEM in at least 85% of the U.S. Sprinter vehicle fleet (“National Sprinter EMP Rate”) by three years from the Effective Date of the consent decree or three years from approval of the last-submitted Sprinter EMC (EMC 3), whichever is later. For each percentage point by which Daimler falls short of the National Passenger Car EMP Rate, Daimler must pay a civil penalty of $6,445,600 to the United States. For each percentage point by which Daimler falls short of the National Sprinter EMP Rate, Daimler must pay a civil penalty of $9,137,866 to the United States. There are separate California EMP Rates under the consent decree for Passenger Cars and Sprinters registered in California. Daimler must meet the 85% California Passenger Car EMP Rate and 85% California Sprinter EMP Rate or pay $1,325,910 and $1,485,655, respectively, for each percentage point by which Daimler falls short of the California EMP Rates. Daimler must offer a broad extended warranty for vehicles once the AEM is installed, covering all hardware or software affected by the AEM. Daimler must also conduct additional testing in the coming years to demonstrate to EPA and CARB that the vehicles continue to meet emission standards over their full useful life. State and Regional Partners The California Air Resources Board joined the United States in this settlement. Mitigation Daimler must implement a program to fully mitigate the lifetime excess NOx emissions from the vehicles it sold in violation of the Clean Air Act. The mitigation program requires Daimler to replace or repower 15 older, more-polluting line-haul locomotive engines to more stringent emissions standards than the standards to which they were certified, thereby reducing emissions from these locomotives. In selecting locomotives, Daimler shall preferentially repower those that are likely to run long distances to geographically diverse locations across the continental United States, except that Defendants shall not be required to repower locomotives located in or traveling to California because there is a separate mitigation program in California.

Daimler AG is a publicly-held German corporation with its headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. Daimler AG and its subsidiaries manufactured and assembled the vehicles, imported many of the vehicles, performed emission tests on the vehicles, met with EPA regulators about the vehicles, and submitted information about the vehicles to EPA. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MB USA) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Daimler AG, and is a Delaware limited liability company with its headquarters in Sandy Springs, GA. MB USA acts for and is under the control of Daimler AG in connection with the distribution of new motor vehicles in the United States. MB USA is also listed as a manufacturer in certain certificate of conformity (COC) applications submitted to EPA. Overview EPA alleged that Daimler installed undisclosed software functions and defeat devices in approximately 250,000 light and medium-duty diesel vehicles (passenger cars and Sprinter vans, model years 2009-2016). The undisclosed software functions and defeat devices cause the vehicles’ emission control systems to perform differently, and less effectively, during certain normal driving conditions than on federal emission tests, resulting in increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen (“NOx”) during typical vehicle operation. NOx includes harmful air pollutants linked to cardiac and respiratory disease. This settlement resolves the complaint filed by the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA. The California Air Resources Board is a co-plaintiff to this settlement. Civil Penalty Daimler will pay a civil penalty of $875,000,000 for its alleged civil violations of the Clean Air Act. Of that amount, the company will pay $743,750,000 to the United States and $131,250,000 to CARB. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits NOx pollution contributes to the formation of harmful smog and soot, exposure to which is linked to a number of respiratory- and cardiovascular-related health effects as well as premature death. Children, older adults, people who are active outdoors (including outdoor workers), and people with heart or lung disease are particularly at risk for health effects related to smog or soot exposure. Nitrogen dioxide formed by NOx emissions can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, and may also contribute to asthma development in children. Actions to Prevent Future Violations Daimler will take various measures to prevent future violations. Daimler will maintain its recent corporate reorganization, which separates emissions certification and product development activities. Daimler will perform enhanced annual technical training on certification compliance requirements and will also publish its Compliance Operation Plan which will include details about the company’s internal controls around emissions compliance. The company will perform portable emission measurement system (PEMS) testing on its new diesel and gasoline vehicles, and special-cycle testing of select diesel vehicles, to assess whether the vehicles operate similarly on the federal emissions test cycles as compared to off-cycle, typical driving conditions. This testing will be performed prior to certification, which will enable the EPA to take the PEMS results into account in making new-vehicle certification decisions. Lastly, Daimler will conduct internal audits by a dedicated settlement compliance team, observed by an external compliance consultant, to assess the implementation of the consent decree requirements. Clean Air Act Certification Requirements and Violations The Clean Air Act and its regulations aim to protect human health and the environment, in part, by reducing harmful emissions from mobile sources of air pollution. The Act requires vehicle manufacturers to demonstrate to EPA through a certification process that their products meet applicable federal emission standards to control air pollution. As part of the certification process, automakers are required to disclose and explain any functions, known as auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs), that can alter how a vehicle emits air pollution. Daimler did not disclose the existence of certain AECDs to EPA in its certificate applications for approximately 250,000 model year 2009 – 2016 light and medium-duty diesel vehicles sold in the United States, despite knowing that AECDs were present and that disclosure of such is mandatory. In addition, the Clean Air Act makes it a violation to manufacture, sell, offer to sell, or install defeat devices. A defeat device is a vehicle design feature that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and use. A certificate of conformity (COC) covers only those new motor vehicles that conform, in all material respects, to the design specifications described in the manufacturer’s application for that COC. Manufacturers are prohibited from selling any new motor vehicle in the United States unless that vehicle is covered by an EPA-issued COC. By selling approximately 250,000 diesel vehicles that contain undisclosed AECDs and one or more defeat devices, Daimler violated important provisions of Section 203 the Clean Air Act. Vehicle Repair: Reducing their Harmful Emissions Daimler must recall the affected vehicles and update the software and certain hardware in order to remove all defeat devices and ensure the vehicles comply with all applicable emission standards. Due to variation within the affected Daimler fleet, there are 12 subgroups of fixes, or vehicle updates. The updates are known as Approved Emissions Modifications (AEMs). The 12 subgroups are known as “Emission Modification Categories 1 - 12,” or “EMCs 1 - 12.” Each AEM includes a Daimler-developed software repair and a hardware upgrade. The hardware changes vary across EMCs; however, each vehicle shall receive a new NOx sensor, and any vehicle not already equipped with a copper catalyst will have one installed. EPA and CARB have already approved the AEMs for eight EMCs (EMCs 1 - 4 and 9 - 12). The agencies will approve the remaining updates (EMCs 5 - 8) in a staggered fashion through 2021, based on their review of Daimler’s proposed updates and emissions test results demonstrating that each update will ensure the relevant vehicles comply with applicable emission standards. Daimler will be liable for stipulated penalties in the unlikely event that one or more AEMs do not meet the applicable emission standards, and any excess NOx emissions from this noncompliance will be covered by the federal mitigation project required under the consent decree (CD).",875000000

IPL will install a pollution control device known as a Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction System (SNCR) on one of the plant’s coal-fired units, upgrade its sulfuric acid mitigation system, and continually operate all of its pollution control equipment to meet levels that will achieve reductions in NOx, SO2, PM and H2SO4 emissions. The agreement recognizes that IPL may permanently retire two of its Petersburg units earlier than it had planned. Retirement of those units would result in emission reductions significantly greater than any reductions achieved by installing and operating the SNCR. Thus, IPL may forego installing that control device if it in fact retires the two units prior to July 1, 2023, the deadline under the agreement by which IPL must install the SNCR. Under the agreement, IPL will also undertake a project costing $5 million to mitigate the harm to the environment caused by the plant’s excess emissions over the years. IPL will submit a proposal to EPA and the State to construct and operate a system that will provide a new, non-emitting source of power at an on-site location known as the auxiliary electrical unit. The new source of power is expected to reduce emissions of SO2, NOx and PM from that unit. In addition, at the request of Indiana, IPL will expend $325,000 to undertake a state-only environmentally beneficial project designed to restore and preserve some ecologically significant parcels of land near the plant. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, is subject to a 30-day public comment period following notification in the Federal Register and to final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Contacts for Further Information Sabrina Argentieri Attorney-Adviser Air Enforcement Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW (Mail Code 2243A) Washington, DC, 20460 (202) 564-8953argintieri.sabrina@epa.gov Civil Penalty IPL will pay a total civil penalty of $1.525 million, of which $925,000 will go to the United States and $600,000 to the State of Indiana. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The pollutants reduced under this settlement have numerous adverse environmental and health effects. Sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides can be converted to fine particulate matter once in the air. Fine particulates can be breathed in and lodged deep in the lungs, leading to a variety of health problems and even premature death. Other health and environmental impacts from the pollutants addressed in this settlement include the following: Sulfur dioxide – High concentrations of SO2 affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children, and the elderly. Sulfur dioxide is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain. Particulate matter – Short term exposure to particulate matter can aggravate lung disease, cause asthma attacks and acute bronchitis, may increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and has been linked to heart attacks. Nitrogen oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Sulfuric Acid Mist – SAM is a corrosive chemical and can severely burn the skin and eyes. It may cause third degree burns and blindness on contact. Exposure to SAM can irritate the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, and at higher levels can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Asthmatics are particularly sensitive to the pulmonary irritation. Repeated exposures may cause permanent damage to the lungs and teeth. Overview Indianapolis Power & Light Company, a subsidiary of AES and also known as IPL, is a utility company providing electric service to the City of Indianapolis. IPL provides electric service to more than 470,000 customers. IPL is the owner and operator of the Petersburg Generating Station. Violations During 2008, 2015, and 2016, EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management conducted investigations of the Petersburg Generating Station. Based upon information obtained during the investigations, EPA issued three Findings and Notices of Violation to IPL for the following Clean Air Act violations: (1) failure to obtain a permit and install controls as required by Prevention of Significant Deterioration provision and the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) and (2) emissions in excess of opacity standards under the New Source Performance Standards for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Steam Generators, Subpart D, the Indiana SIP, and the Petersburg Generating Station’s Title V Operating Permit. Pollutant Impacts Full implementation of the settlement will result in emission reductions of SO2, NOx, H2SO4/PM by 58,055, 4,532, and 2,630 tons per year, respectively.","1,525,000"
44,"City of Hattiesburg, MS Clean Water Act Settlement Information Sheet"," On Wednesday, August 26, 2020, the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the State of Mississippi, acting through the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), lodged a proposed Consent Decree with the City of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The goal of the proposed Consent Decree is for the City to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs), and to achieve and maintain full compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Mississippi Air and Water Pollution Control Law, and the City's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permits. On this page:",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/city-hattiesburg-ms-clean-water-act-settlement-information-sheet,Consent Decree,2020-08-26,"Settlement Resources Consent Decree Overview of Company Violations Injunctive Relief Pollutant Impacts Health and Environmental Effects Civil Penalty State Partner Comment Period Contact Total Suspended Solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients – Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive Injunctive Relief Hattiesburg estimates that it will spend approximately $35 to $45 million over approximately 16 years (196 months) to complete the injunctive relief and bring its operations into compliance with the CWA. The Consent Decree requires Hattiesburg to undertake several Early Action Projects to replace and/or rehabilitate certain portions of the WCTS and are intended to address conditions that are causing SSOs in the WCTS. The City will complete the Early Action Projects by December 31, 2024 and estimates that it will spend approximately $14,293,000 on the Early Action Projects. The Decree also requires the City to perform sewer assessment and rehabilitation work in two “Priority Areas” to, among other things, address infiltration and inflow (I/I), structural defects, and other conditions causing, or that are likely to cause, SSOs. The Priority Areas represent approximately forty-three percent (43%) of the WCTS by linear foot, and the vast majority of the City’s wet weather capacity related SSOs. The Consent Decree requires a sewer system evaluation/rehabilitation (SSER) for the Priority Areas. The SSER will include the following components: corrosion defect identification; manhole condition assessment and rehabilitation; flow monitoring; closed circuit television inspection; gravity sewer line defect analysis and rehabilitation; smoke testing; force main condition assessment and rehabilitation; and pump station performance and rehabilitation. The Consent Decree also requires Hattiesburg to develop and implement specific and comprehensive management, operations, and maintenance, also referred to as MOM, programs including: a sewer overflow response plan; an emergency response plan; an information management system program; a sewer mapping program; a gravity sewer system operations and maintenance program; a pump station operations and preventative maintenance program; a fats, oils, and grease control program; a training program; and a Priority Areas chronic SSO advanced remote monitoring program. To increase transparency, the Consent Decree requires Hattiesburg to post on its website all deliverables that are to be prepared and/or submitted pursuant to the Consent Decree, along with instructions to the public for receiving email notice when deliverables are posted. In addition, the Consent Decree requires Hattiesburg to allow the public an opportunity to comment on the major deliverables before Hattiesburg submits them to the EPA for review. Comment Period The proposed consent decree was published in the Federal Register on September 1, 2020 and is subject to a 30-day public comment period and court approval. It will be available for viewing on the DOJ’s website until the public comment period closes on October 1, 2020.

Hattiesburg’s total estimated service population is approximately 41,241, not including residents from the City of Petal. In addition to its own service areas, Hattiesburg collects and transports sewage from the City of Petal, Mississippi for treatment at its South Lagoon facility. The City of Petal is an external jurisdiction with a service population of approximately 9,573 and is responsible for the operation and maintenance of its own WCTS. Hattiesburg is permitted to discharge treated sewage from its Lagoons into the Leaf River and the Bouie River. The Bouie River is a major tributary of the Leaf River. The Leaf and Bouie Rivers are waterbodies within the Pascagoula River Basin. The Pascagoula River eventually discharges into Pascagoula Bay before entering the Gulf of Mexico. The State of Mississippi has developed Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), under Section 303(d)(1)(C) of the CWA, for segments of the Leaf and the Bouie Rivers that are directly impacted by Hattiesburg’s sewer system. TMDLs were developed for the Leaf River for fecal coliform and nutrients. TMDLs were developed for the Bouie River for sediment, low dissolved oxygen, and nutrients. Civil Penalty In addition to these compliance costs, the proposed Consent Decree also requires Hattiesburg to pay a civil penalty of $165,600, to be divided equally between the United States and the State of Mississippi. The proposed Consent Decree also includes a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) valued at $220,800, which will result in the reduction of extraneous flows entering the WCTS through defective private laterals and through illicit connections from residential properties the owners of which face financial hardship. Violations The proposed Consent Decree addresses CWA violations by Hattiesburg with respect to its publicly owned treatment works in Mississippi, including numerous SSOs and violations of its NPDES permit as a result of its failure to properly operate and maintain its Wastewater Collection and Transmission Systems. Pollutant Impacts Through the implementation of the proposed consent decree, the following estimated annual pollutant reductions will result: 1,013 pounds of total suspended solids; 970 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand; 2,428 pounds of chemical oxygen demand; 157 pounds of total nitrogen; and 22 pounds of total phosphorous",".

45,Cleanup Order Requires Investigation and Study to Address Groundwater Contamination," On August 7, 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a unilateral administrative order (UAO) to the Boeing Company and TDY Industries, LLC. requiring the companies to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) on Operable Unit 7 at the Pools Prairie Superfund site in Neosha, Missouri. The Phase II RI/FS will further characterize the nature and extent of site related contamination and evaluate the potential remedial alternatives for the site. Since the parties were unable to resolve settlement issues, Boeing and TDY agreed that EPA issuing a UAO was the best option to keep the work moving forward. The value of the RI/FS UAO is $2.7 million. The RI/FS will help the nearby community by providing more comprehensive indoor air evaluation and additional source area cleanup to address contaminated groundwater, resulting in further access to safe drinking water and providing clean water for those homes that opted to use well water rather than be connected to the public water system.

	Contact",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/city-manchester-nh-clean-water-act-settlement-information-sheet,Consent Decree,2020-07-13,"Related Information Press release Consent Decree Injunctive Relief The proposed settlement includes a 20.5-year plan to control and significantly reduce overflows of its sewer system, which will improve water quality of the Merrimack River. The plan is estimated to cost $231 million to implement. The settlement addresses problems with Manchester’s combined sewer system, which when overwhelmed by rain and stormwater, frequently discharges raw sewage, industrial waste, nitrogen, phosphorus and polluted stormwater into the Merrimack River and its tributaries. The two major CSO abatement controls will disconnect Cemetery Brook in Manchester, the largest of the local five significant connected brooks, from the city’s combined sewer system. Manchester will design and construct a new 2.5 mile drain for Cemetery Brook from Mammoth Road to the Merrimack River to convey both the brook’s and storm drainage flows, ranging in size conceptually from 6-foot-wide by 5-foot-tall box culvert to 12-foot-wide by 10-foot-tall at the downstream terminus. The city will also design and construct projects to separate the combined sewers for areas adjacent to the Cemetery Brook drain. These drainage and sewer separation projects will together address the largest drainage basin in the city and produce the greatest volume of CSO reduction. The work under the proposed consent decree also includes the construction of a new drain and sewer separation in the Christian Brook drainage basin, which will remove the third largest brook from the wastewater collection system. The proposed consent decree also requires the city to implement a CSO discharge monitoring and notification program, which will include direct measurement of all discharges from six CSO outfalls estimated to be more than 99 percent of all of the city’s total CSO discharge volumes. The city will be required to provide initial and supplemental notification to the public, including public health departments and downstream communities, with notification made through electronic means such as posting to the city’s publicly available website and reasonable efforts to provide other notification. The proposed settlement also requires upgrades to improve the handling of solid waste at the wastewater treatment plant to reduce discharges of phosphorous. Comment Period The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and court approval after it is published in the Federal Register. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Contacts for Further Information Sarah Rae Attorney-Adviser Water Enforcement Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW (Mail Code 2243A) Washington, DC, 20460 (202) 564-2841rae.sarah@epa.gov State Partner The State of New Hampshire, acting through its Department of Environmental Services, has joined as a co-plaintiff and brings its own parallel claims under the New Hampshire Water Pollution and Waste Disposal Act, NH RSA 485-A. Health and Environmental Effects Total Suspended Solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) – COD is a measure based on the chemical decomposition of organic and inorganic contaminants, dissolved or suspended in water. As with BOD, high levels of COD indicate high levels of pollutants are present in the wastewater that will consume oxygen from the water and may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients – Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive Overview The City of Manchester owns and operates a publicly owned treatment works (POTW), including a wastewater treatment facility (WWTF), that serves the City of Manchester and portions of Bedford, Londonderry, and Goffstown, New Hampshire and approximately 155,000 people. The wastewater collection system tributary to the treatment plant has six interceptors totaling over 23 miles in length, 11 pump stations, four inverted siphons, 13 miles of force mains, approximately 385 miles of sewer pipe (of which 45 percent are combined sewers), 15 combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfalls, and over 10,000 manholes. Pursuant to the City’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, Manchester’s sewer collection system is authorized to convey wastewater to the WWTF for treatment and discharge to the Merrimack River, and, when capacity in the system is reached, to discharge through CSO outfalls into receiving waters including the Merrimack River, Piscataquog River, Ray Brook and Tannery Brook. Violations The Complaint alleges that the City of Manchester violates Section 301 of the Clean Water Act and terms and conditions of its NPDES permit by discharging from its CSO outfalls combined sewage, which contains pollutants in excess of the amounts allowed under New Hampshire water quality standards. Pollutant Impacts The Merrimack River is a drinking water source for more than 500,000 people, is stocked with bass and trout for fishing, and is used for kayaking and boating and other recreational opportunities. Many of the communities in the Merrimack River watershed are environmental justice communities with large numbers of minority and low-income residents. The volume of combined sewage that overflows from Manchester’s combined sewer system is approximately 280 million gallons annually, which is approximately half of the combined sewage discharge volume from all communities to the Merrimack River. Under the proposed consent decree, Manchester will install CSO control projects and upgrades at its wastewater treatment facilities that are expected to reduce the city’s total annual combined sewer discharge volume by approximately 74 percent from approximately 280 million gallons to 73 million gallons. Data over the past nine years reveal levels of E. coli colonies ranging from 1,250 to 560,000 colonies per 100 milliliters, in excess of the amounts allowed under New Hampshire water quality standards and the city’s NPDES permit of 1,000 colonies per 100 milliliters. Through the implementation of the proposed consent decree, the following estimated annual pollutant reductions will result: 1,814,450 pounds of total suspended solids; 535,695 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand; 881,304 pounds of chemical oxygen demand; 16,416 pounds of total nitrogen; and 3,283 pounds of total phosphorus.",231 million

Washington, DC 20460 202-564-4006stephanos.ann@epa.gov Civil Penalty DuPont will pay a civil penalty of $3.195M to resolve the alleged past violations of RCRA, CWA and CAA and the penalty will be split with the State of Texas who is a co-plaintiff in this action. Overview of Company DuPont is a large multinational corporation engaged in chemical manufacturing at many facilities across the United States. E.I du Pont De Nemours merged with Dow Chemical Company in 2017 and split into three publicly traded companies: agriculture (Corteva), materials science (“Dow Inc.”), and specialty products (DuPont). The legal entity E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (the ""original"" DuPont of 200 years of existence) still exits and will continue to exist. As part of the DowDuPont merger and spin-off, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (""EID"") became a wholly owned subsidiary of the agriscience company Corteva Inc. EID continues to be the property owner of the La Porte facility. At the La Porte facility, DuPont produced agrichemicals (herbicides, pesticides and insecticides), organic chemicals (nonhalogenated vinyl compounds), and inorganic chemicals (sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid). On November 15, 2014, there was an explosion in the Lannate Process Area which killed 4 employees when methyl mercaptan, a toxic chemical used in the company’s insecticide and fungicide manufacturing process, was released. Lannate is an insecticide with methomyl as the active ingredient. The Lannate Process Area was shut down following the explosion and in March 2016, DuPont announced that it would permanently close the Lannate Process Area and cease its agrichemical manufacturing operations, but would continue to operate its wastewater treatment system for third-party tenant operators. Environmental Benefits The RCRA injunctive relief requires full determinations of all solid wastes handled at the facility. This will ensure that all hazardous characteristics of the waste will be known and properly addressed and that contaminants will not be unknowingly released into the San Jacinto Bay. The RCRA injunctive relief also requires investigation and characterization of any contamination in and from the units associated with the wastewater treatment system. This will ensure that any contamination is discovered and properly addressed and any impacts to the groundwater or the surrounding environment from the units will be addressed. This includes contaminants that could migrate through the groundwater and enter surface waters of the Houston Ship Channel and the San Jacinto River, where they could adversely affect receptor organisms that have habitats in those areas. The CWA injunctive relief ensures that potentially spilled material does not discharge into waterways. The CAA injunctive relief requires that wastewaters treated in a biological treatment unit are thoroughly mixed and properly controlled to prevent the release of pollutants considered probable human carcinogens when inhaled, resulting in adverse health effects following exposure. Violations This settlement resolves DuPont’s liability for alleged violations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), including failure to determine if a solid waste is a hazardous waste (30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 335.62 and 335.70 and 40 C.F.R.§§ 262.11 and 262.40); treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste without a permit or interim status (42 U.S.C. § 6925(a) and 40 C.F.R. Parts 264/265 and 270 and 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 335.43(a)); failure to perform land disposal determinations and to meet land disposal restrictions for hazardous wastes (Tex. Admin. Code § 335.431(c)(1) and 40 C.F.R. Part 268); failure to provide financial assurance for closure, long-term care, and third-party liability for all storage/disposal units that received hazardous waste (30 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 37.6021 and 335.179(b) and 335.128(a) and 40 C.F.R. §§ 264.143 and 265.143); failure to implement secondary containment for a diesel tank, as required by 40 C.F.R. § 112.7; failure to fully implement the facility’s Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (“SPCC”) plan in violation of CWA Section 311(j)(1)(C), 33 U.S.C § 1321(j)(1)(C) and failure to comply with Pesticide Active Ingredient (“PAI”) MACT at its Biological Water Treatment unit as required by 40 C.F.R. § 63.138(a) and 40 C.F.R. §§ 63.145(h)(1) and 63.1362(d). Pollutant Impacts The facility is located within the drainage area of the Houston Ship Channel and San Jacinto River. It is bounded on the north and east by the San Jacinto Bay and on the south and west by other industrial landowners. The wastewater treatment unit is comprised of unlined surface impoundments. The Decree includes RCRA corrective action obligations for these units to ensure cleanup of any soil, sediment or groundwater contamination, if identified through sampling. DuPont currently operates monitoring wells in the uppermost aquifer to evaluate the extent of groundwater contamination pursuant to an existing corrective action permit.","$3,195,000"

Environmental Protection Agency 1595 Wynkoop Street (8ORC-R) Denver, Colorado 80202 303-312-6108greenblum.max@epa.gov Civil Penalty Simplot will pay a civil penalty of $775,000 to resolve the alleged past violations of RCRA and EPCRA. Environmental Benefits By operating its Acid Value Recovery System, Simplot will reduce the quantity of acidic wastes sent to the gypsum stack for disposal, and beneficially re-use in production the phosphate from those materials that otherwise would need to be obtained from mined phosphate ore. Simplot will also implement a Best Management Practices plan to better identify and prevent leaks and spills from its manufacturing plant. All of these projects are designed to ensure that acidic wastewaters and any contamination are controlled within the lined gypsum stack system and plant site. Simplot developed a gypsum stack closure plan to ensure that when production operations cease, all acidic wastewaters will be neutralized and treated to remove any hazardous contaminants, and that the gypsum stack will be structurally stable and revegetated. Simplot is providing surety bonds to secure financial assurance for closure of its gypsum stack in the amount of $126 million so that the taxpayers will not be at risk of paying for future closure or cleanup at the facility. Overview of Companies J.R. Simplot Company is a privately-held food and agribusiness company, incorporated in Nevada, with its principal corporate offices in Boise, Idaho. At the Rock Springs facility, Simplot principally manufactures phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizer products. Simplot was an owner and operator of the facility beginning in 1992, in a joint venture with Farmland Industries, Inc. Simplot has been the sole owner and operator since 2003, when it purchased its joint venture partner’s interest in the operation and renamed it Simplot Phosphates, LLC. Violations This settlement resolves Simplot’s liability for alleged violations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), including failure to determine if a solid waste is a hazardous waste (40 C.F.R. § 262.11); treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste in the phosphogypsum (gypsum) stack without a permit or interim status (42 U.S.C. § 6925(a) and 40 C.F.R. Parts 264/265 and 270); failure to perform land disposal determinations and to meet land disposal restrictions for hazardous wastes (40 C.F.R. Part 268); and failure to submit complete Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) annual toxic release reports (42 U.S.C. § 11023 and the implementing regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 372). Pollutant Impacts Process wastewater and gypsum solids are piped from the manufacturing plant to the gypsum stack, and all of the ditches and ponds connected to the gypsum stack are lined with high density polyethylene (HDPE). A HDPE liner is also present under the gypsum stack which prevents the release of potentially hazardous wastewaters (corrosive) to the environment. A lined intercept ditch is located downgradient from the gypsum stack to detect and capture any leaks, and Simplot conducted a four year investigation that found no environmental impacts to the groundwater, and installed several dozen additional groundwater monitoring wells to enhance its ability to quickly detect and respond to any leaks around the gypsum stack.",776000
50,Third-Party Agreement Supports Cleanup and Redevelopment at Site in Texas," In July 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), and Conroe Logistics Center, LLC (CLC) entered into a Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser (BFPP) agreement related to the Conroe Creosoting Superfund site in Conroe, Texas. CLC agreed to perform some of the federal cleanup work needed on the portion of the site that they purchased, including dioxin testing, vapor intrusion assessment, and plugging of wells to prevent the movement of contaminants or injection fluids. The company’s redevelopment plans include construction of a large distribution building that will provide numerous benefits to the community, including the creation of permanent and temporary jobs and the generation of tax revenues. The BFPP agreement supports the redevelopment of a long-blighted property consistent with the community’s reuse plans that likely would not happen in the absence of this agreement.

Wood-treating operations took place at the approximately 147-acre facility from 1946 to 1997. Three wood preserving chemicals – pentachlorophenol, creosote, and copper chromated arsenate – were used in these operations, leading to contamination of the soil, sediment and groundwater at the site. In 2003, EPA listed the site on the National Priorities List and issued a record of decision (ROD) that explains the cleanup plan for the site, which includes monitored natural attenuation of groundwater as well as institutional controls to prevent future installation of water supply wells and restrict future development of the site to non-residential uses. In 2008, EPA determined that the site was ready for commercial/industrial reuse as long as the requirements of the ROD are met.

HollyFrontier Corporation, through its subsidiaries, operates five refineries with approximately 457,000 barrels per day of crude oil processing capacity. Pollutant Impacts When fully implemented, EPA estimates that the new controls and requirements would result in emission reductions of approximately 7.5 tons per year of PM emissions and 2.1 tons per year of SO2 emissions. Violations HollyFrontier repeatedly violated regulations prohibiting visible smoke emissions from the refinery’s main flare, resulting in releases of potentially harmful particulate matter. In addition, the company on several instances exceeded regulatory limits for hydrogen sulfide in fuel gas, failed to monitor for hydrogen sulfide, and failed to minimize emissions using good air pollution control practices, all of which resulted in harmful releases of sulfur dioxide. HollyFrontier also failed to design and maintain a safe facility, and failed to comply with chemical accident prevention regulations, including failure to inspect and test equipment and correct deficiencies in equipment. These prevention failures led to a September 2017 catastrophic release of naptha, a flammable hydrocarbon mixture, which resulted in a fire and the subsequent death of one employee.",4000000
54,Sprague Clean Air Act Settlement," (Boston, MA - May 28, 2020) - Under a proposed settlement with the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Sprague Resources LP will take steps to limit emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from oil storage tanks at seven facilities across New England. The terms of the proposed settlement are designed to bring Sprague into compliance with federal air pollution control laws that regulate the emissions of VOCs from heated #6 oil and asphalt tanks, which can pose public health risks.

Sprague’s facilities currently have no effective permit limits on their potential VOC emissions from #6 oil and asphalt products. This settlement requires the affected Sprague facilities to obtain permits or permit amendments that limit VOC emissions by restricting the number and type of heated petroleum storage tanks that can be operated at each facility, and by restricting the annual amount of #6 oil and asphalt that can flow through each facility. These measures will limit each facility to substantially below its design capacity, and ensure that each facility operates only as a minor source of VOC emissions (emitting less than 50 tons per year). The proposed settlement effectively limits VOC emissions from facilities that previously had no such limits. For more information, contact: Tom Olivier (Case Attorney)Olivier.Tom@epa.gov 617-918-1737 Dave Deegan (Media Inquiries)Deegan.Dave@epa.gov 617-918-1017 Civil Penalty The proposed decree requires that Sprague pay $350,000 in civil penalties, including $205,000 to the United States and $145,000 to Massachusetts. Overview of Company Sprague owns and operates a number of petroleum storage and distribution facilities in New England. Some of its facilities handle heavy petroleum products such as #6 oil (also known as “bunker fuel” or “residual oil”) and asphalt, which need to be heated in order to remain in liquid form for storage or to move through pipes for receipt or distribution. Health and Environmental Benefits VOC emissions contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone. To reduce ozone levels, the Clean Air Act and state air pollution laws require state permits to limit emissions. VOCs include a variety of chemicals that may produce adverse health effects such as eye, nose, and throat irritation, headaches, nausea, and damage to the liver, kidney, and central nervous system. Breathing ozone formed from VOCs can trigger a variety of health problems, particularly in children, the elderly, and anyone with a lung disease such as asthma. Ozone can also have harmful effects on sensitive vegetation and ecosystems. This case addresses VOC emissions only. EPA required Sprague to conduct testing for emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from its heated storage tanks at its facility in Searsport, Maine, in 2012 and 2013. The results indicated that the HAP emissions from these tanks were not enough to trigger federal requirements to implement HAP emission controls. The settlement requires Sprague to install, operate and maintain carbon bed systems designed to reduce odors from #6 oil and/or asphalt tanks at its South Portland, Maine, and Quincy, Massachusetts, facilities. These facilities have been the subject of numerous odor complaints from area residents. In addition to the proposed federal Consent Decree negotiated by the United States and Massachusetts, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) notified EPA that it has been working to address violations of Rhode Island’s Odor Regulation at Sprague’s facility in Providence, Rhode Island, outlined in a Notice of Violation issued to Sprague on May 16, 2019. As a result, Sprague has installed equipment to control odors emanating from three heated bulk storage tanks located at the facility that currently store liquid asphalt and #6 oil and/or other heavy petroleum products. This equipment includes a carbon bed and mist eliminator. As of April 21, 2020, this odor control system was operational on all three of these tanks. RIDEM has reported that it continues to work directly with Sprague to ensure that the company resolves this state enforcement action and complies with all applicable odor control regulations. Comment Period The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Copies of the complaint and the proposed consent decree, and instructions on how to submit comments, information on is available at the Department of Justice. Violations The proposed settlement with Sprague by the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts addresses alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act, Massachusetts air pollution laws, and federal and state regulations governing permits for the control of VOCs. These laws limit VOC emissions to the air because of their contribution to the formation of ground‑level ozone, a component of photochemical smog or haze, which pose risks to public health. The alleged violations occurred at Sprague’s New England facilities that store heavy petroleum products, including #6 oil and asphalt, in large heated tanks. These heated petroleum tanks emit VOCs. At high temperatures certain substances within these petroleum products vaporize—changing from liquid to vapor—and are vented to the air. Among other things, asphalt is used for paving roads and #6 oil is used to heat industrial boilers. In 2011, EPA’s New England office launched an investigation into VOC emissions from the storage and distribution of #6 oil and asphalt products in New England. After reviewing years of records and conducting a comprehensive emissions testing program, EPA discovered that VOC emissions from Sprague’s heated tanks exceed previously estimated emission levels. As a result, EPA found that the facilities addressed by the United States’ Complaint were not meeting state permitting requirements with respect to VOCs. Between April 2014 and June 2017, EPA issued notices of violation to Sprague for each facility. In addition to its investigation of Sprague’s facilities, EPA investigated a #6 oil and asphalt facility in South Portland, Maine, owned and operated by Global Partners LP, which resulted in a consent decree, approved by the Federal District Court in Maine on December 19, 2019. Pollutant Impacts These VOC emission reduction measures are designed to meet each state’s permitting requirements for ozone control and to control ozone levels in the “ozone transport region,” which encompasses states from Delaware to Maine. All of the states affected by this settlement are in attainment with the national ambient air quality standards for ozone. The consent decree requirements will help these states remain in compliance with these ozone standards. These measures will reduce VOC emissions, improve air quality, and reduce public health risks.","350,000"

From that date through the end of April 2020, several other EPA Regions discovered similar shipments at many different ports around the country of Electrolux dehumidifiers and air conditioner products with the same claims, through in-person inspections and by reviewing import filings and website claims. Upon review of the information gathered by the EPA Regions, and information submitted by Electrolux about its products, EPA was able to determine that the products being imported contained filters manufactured with nanosilver, which were intended to have a pesticidal effect on bacteria and improve air quality for the consumer. EPA determined that these products were pesticides that must be registered before being distributed or sold. Based on EPA’s reason to believe Electrolux was importing, and therefore, distributing, unregistered pesticide products, the Agency issued a SSURO on May 27, 2020. Electrolux Home Products, Inc. Resources Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order Termination of Stop Sale, Use, or Removal Order Issued to Electrolux Home Products, Inc. (pdf) (146.98 KB) Background Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), all pesticide products, with minor exceptions, must be registered with EPA before being distributed or sold in the United States. A “pesticide product” is a pesticide in the particular form (including composition, packaging, and labeling) in which the pesticide is, or is intended to be, distributed or sold, and includes any physical apparatus used to deliver or apply the pesticide if distributed or sold with the pesticide. FIFRA defines “pesticide” to include any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest. FIFRA defines “to distribute or sell” to include the acts of distributing, shipping, selling, and offering for sale, among others. Section 17 of FIFRA, and the regulations implementing that provision, require that importers of pesticides and devices regulated by FIFRA file a Notice of Arrival of Pesticides and Devices (“NOA”), in either paper or electronic form. EPA has the authority under FIFRA section 13(a) to issue a SSURO to any person who owns, controls, or has custody of a pesticide or device that EPA has reason to believe, on the basis of inspection or tests, is in violation of FIFRA, or has been or is intended to be distributed or sold in violation of FIFRA. After receipt of such order no person shall sell, use, or remove the pesticide or device described in the order except in accordance with the provisions in the order. Under FIFRA section 14(a), EPA may assess civil penalties to any person that has unlawfully distributed or sold unregistered pesticides. For more information, contact: Adrienne Trivedi U.S. EPA Headquarters William Jefferson Clinton Building 1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20460 (202) 564-7862trivedi.adrienne@epa.gov Summary of the Order Pursuant to the authority in FIFRA section 13(a), EPA ordered Electrolux to immediately stop the sale, use, or removal of the products described in the SSURO, except as provided therein. The SSURO permitted all movements necessary of any subject products under Electrolux’s ownership, control or custody, for the purposes of consolidating them for rework (whereby the nanosilver filters would be replaced with non-substance filters, and the claims would be removed). Once products were certified as being reworked successfully, the SSURO provided that they may be released into commerce. On February 23, 2022, after receiving certification that all subject products were either reworked or destroyed, and determining there was no longer a reason to believe Electrolux was distributing the unregistered pesticides, EPA terminated the SSURO.

The Omega location became a Superfund site in 1999, when it was added to the Superfund National Priorities List. Since that time EPA has overseen the removal of more than 2,700 drums as well as more than 12,500 pounds of contaminants from the soil and groundwater. This effort has included treatment of more than 30 million gallons of contaminated groundwater since 2009. The groundwater contamination is believed to result from spills, leaks, and poor chemical handling practices at the Omega Chemical facility and at other industrial operations in the area. Subsurface soil and groundwater at and around the site have high concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), freons and other contaminants. Consumption of high levels of TCE and PCE for extended periods of time can cause damage to the nervous system, liver and lungs and increase risk of cancer.

Injunctive Relief The UG estimates that implementation of the Integrated Overflow Control Plan (IOCP) will cost over $600 million. The UG estimates that implementation of the Integrated Overflow Control Plan (IOCP) will cost over $600 million. The IOCP includes projects to address sanitary sewer overflows (SSO) and combined sewer overflows (CSO) as well as sewer system and MS4 infrastructure work and remedial measures. The settlement requires completion of the construction and full implementation of all remedial and control measures by 2044. Implementation of the IOCP comes as a final phase of this settlement, following prior completion of other consent decree requirements for short-term construction projects and improvements to the UG’s Fats, Oil and Grease Control Program Plan (FOG), Information Management System, Storm Water Management Plan, Collection System Release Response Plan (CSRRP), Nine Minimum Controls Plan (NMCP), and Capacity, Management, Operations and Maintenance (CMOM) Program Plan. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The pollutant above-mentioned pollutant reductions which will substantially reduce microbial pathogens, suspended solids, and nutrients releases to the Kansas and Missouri Rivers. Total suspended solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients - Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. The UG serves a high-minority and low-income population with the median household income for the UG’s service population falling below both the state and national average. The injunctive relief outlined in the Integrated Overflow Control Plan specifically requires heightened control in an area of environmental justice concern, and the resulting benefits of these wastewater control projects are concentrated in the eastern third of the city, where environmental justice concerns are the most serious. Violations The United States alleges the following violations against UG: 1) unauthorized discharge of sewage from the sanitary sewer system (both the combined sanitary sewers (CSS) and separate sanitary sewers (SSS); 2) dry weather overflows from the CSS; 3) failure to properly maintain and operate the sewer system in accordance with the standard condition in an NPDES permit; and, 4) violation of the MS4 NPDES permit. Pollutants Impacts When the control measures required by the settlement are implemented, the UG will capture and treat a minimum of 505 million gallons of the current CSO discharge.

Overview of Company Plains Pipeline, L.P. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (“PAAP”), headquartered in Houston, Texas. Plains Pipeline is the registered operator of Line 901, the pipeline from which the Clean Water Act (CWA) violation addressed in this settlement, occurred. PAAP is the parent or umbrella entity and responsible for the daily operations of Plains’ nationwide system. Plains owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and provides logistic services for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Violations This settlement resolves Plains’ liability relating to a Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 311(b), 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b), violation involving the May 19, 2015 discharge of approximately 2,934 barrels of heavy crude-oil at Refugio Beach, near Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara County, California. The May 19, 2015 oil discharge occurred from Plains’ Line 901, a 24-inch diameter crude-oil pipeline that extends approximately 10.7 miles in length from the Los Flores Pump Station to the Gaviota Pump Station, in Santa Barbara County, California. The Line 901 first ruptured at approximately 11 a.m., resulting in the release of approximately 2,934 barrels (bbl) of heavy crude oil. The Line 901 crude oil traveled through three discrete culverts, reached the Refugio State Beach and entered the Pacific Ocean, 722 feet (0.13 miles) from the discharge point. The Refugio Incident caused widespread oiling of the Pacific Ocean, shorelines, and beaches. It resulted in beach and fishing closures, and adversely impacted natural resources such as birds, fish, marine mammals, and their respective habitats. The oil traveled past Los Angeles as far south as Orange County, California.

60,Significant Progress Made in Moving Remedial Design Forward at Portland Harbor in FY2020," In fiscal year (FY) 2020 EPA finalized eight settlement agreements, amended a previous settlement agreement, and issued two unilateral administrative orders for remedial design to address contamination at the Portland Harbor Superfund site in Oregon. These enforcement actions, valued at more than $31.3 million, designate approximately 75% of the active in-water remediation work in remedial design, the process to develop a detailed cleanup plan. In FY 2021, EPA finalized two additional settlements at the site. The settlement agreement for the “Swan Island Project Area” increased the acres designated for active in-water remediation work at the site proceeding with remedial design from 75% to 100%. The second settlement agreement provides for the creation of a database that will store remedial design data obtained during this phase of the cleanup. These two enforcement actions are valuated at a total of approximately $43.5 million; bringing the entire value of the cleanup work currently underway at the site to approximately $74.8 million. The cleanup work resulting from these enforcement actions are a significant step for returning the Lower Willamette River to a healthy, working waterway for all and will impact many groups and communities with environmental justice (EJ) concerns. Roughly 21– 38% of the population living within one mile of the site are part of overburdened communities, and roughly 36– 47% live below the poverty line. A cleaner river will protect Oregonians and help spur a new era for Portland as a river city, one where the lands stretching along the river are revitalized, and companies can invest and bring new jobs to the communities.

Information about the Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Portland Harbor Superfund site encompasses a 10-mile stretch of the Willamette River that includes an in-river and an upland portion located just downstream of the downtown area of Portland. The river is contaminated from decades of industrial use and was added to EPA's National Priorities List in December 2000. Water and sediment at the site are contaminated with many hazardous substances, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins/furans, pesticides and heavy metals. These compounds have been found to be harmful to people and the environment. The City of Portland and the State of Oregon are important partners in the effort to clean up this river. The state and the city entered into a funding agreement with the Agency in May 2019 to incentivize potentially responsible parties to enter into the settlement agreements.

63,Kohler Co. Clean Air Act Settlement Information Sheet," (Washington, DC - January 30, 2020) - The Department of Justice, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the State of California announced today a settlement with Kohler Co. (Kohler) for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and California law. Under the terms of the settlement, Kohler will pay a $20 million civil penalty and retire more than three million kilograms (kgs) of unlawfully generated hydrocarbon (HC) + oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission credits. Retirement of these credits will result in approximately 3,600 tons of HC + NOx emissions reductions. The alleged violations pertain to Kohler’s manufacture and sale of millions of small, nonroad, nonhandheld spark-ignition (Small SI) engines that did not conform to the certification applications Kohler was required to submit to EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). More than 144,000 of the engines were also equipped with a fueling strategy designed to cheat emissions testing standards (commonly referred to as a “defeat device”). Small SI engines are used in lawn mowers, ride-on mowers, commercial landscaping equipment, and generators. In addition to paying a $20 million civil penalty and retiring over three million kgs of HC + NOx emission credits, Kohler will also implement an emissions testing validation plan that includes third-party observation and emissions verification testing, conduct annual audits, implement corporate governance reforms, and conduct annual regulatory compliance training of its employees. The injunctive relief measures are estimated to cost approximately $3.7 million. In a separate settlement agreement resolving California-only claims, Kohler will pay an additional civil penalty of $200,000 and fund a program that will supply $1.8 million worth of solar-battery generators to low-income residents in California that live in areas subject to public safety power shutoffs to mitigate wildfire risk.

State and Regional Partners The California Air Resources Board and the California Attorney General joined the United States in this settlement on behalf of the State of California. Civil Penalty Kohler will pay a civil penalty of $20 million to resolve the allegations made jointly by the United States and California. In a separate settlement agreement resolving California-only claims, Kohler will pay an additional civil penalty of $200,000. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits NOx pollution contributes to the formation of harmful smog and soot, exposure to which is linked to a number of respiratory- and cardiovascular-related health effects as well as premature death. Children, older adults, people who are active outdoors (including outdoor workers that use the equipment at issue in this case), and people with heart or lung disease are particularly at risk for health effects related to smog or soot exposure. Nitrogen dioxide formed by NOx emissions can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, and may also contribute to asthma development in children. Overview In addition to making bathroom, kitchen, and furniture products, Kohler is a leading, global producer of engines, generators, and power supplies for both consumer and industrial applications. In December 2015, Kohler self-disclosed to EPA and CARB that it had been using the wrong test cycle to test many of its Small SI engines. EPA and CARB’s subsequent investigation revealed that millions of additional Small SI engines were noncompliant, including some of which were equipped with a defeat device. Violations The Clean Air Act (CAA) and its regulations aim to protect human health and the environment, in part, by reducing harmful emissions from mobile sources of air pollution. This CAA settlement concerns Small SI engines, which must satisfy emission standards for certain air pollutants, including HC and NOx. Pursuant to the CAA, the EPA administers a certification program to ensure that every engine introduced into United States commerce satisfies applicable emission standards. Under this program, manufacturers apply to the EPA for a certificate of conformity (COC) and must demonstrate in their applications that representative test engines meet emission standards. The EPA issues COCs to engine manufacturers based on these applications. A COC covers only those new engines that conform, in all material respects, to the design specifications described in the manufacturer’s application for that COC. Manufacturers are prohibited from selling any new engine in the United States unless that engine is covered by an EPA-issued COC. The complaint filed by the United States and California alleges that Kohler manufactured and sold millions of Small SI engines that did not conform to the certification applications Kohler submitted. The Small SI engines did not conform to their certification applications for one or more of the following reasons: (1) use of the wrong test cycle, (2) not fully complying with the test procedures Kohler certified to, (3) failure to comply with the applicable emission limits, (4) failure to age emission-related components for deterioration factor testing, (5) failure to disclose auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) and adjustable parameters equipped on the engines, and (6) making changes to the configuration of production engines without amending the certification application covering those engines. The complaint further alleges that Kohler developed and deployed a fueling strategy on at least 144,000 electronic fuel-injected (EFI) Small SI engines that significantly reduced NOx emissions during certification testing when compared to real-world operation (i.e., ran rich during certification testing but lean during in-use operation). The fueling strategy in the calibration—a defeat device—was not disclosed in Kohler’s certification applications and Kohler was aware that the fueling strategy was designed to reduce NOx emissions during certification testing even though the certification results were not representative of real-world operation. In addition, the complaint alleges Kohler also submitted several incomplete or inaccurate certification applications, averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) reports, and production line testing (PLT) reports. Finally, California alleges that certain engines did not conform to applicable evaporative emission standards. These California-only claims are being resolved through a separate settlement agreement between California and Kohler.",No claimable amount in this case.
64,Multiple FY2020 Enforcement Action to Clean Up Gowanus Canal Superfund Site," In fiscal year 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) completed work on 10 enforcement actions for cleanup work, valued at $175 million, at the Gowanus Canal Superfund site in Brooklyn, New York to address the heavily contaminated sediments within the 100-foot wide, 1.8 mile long canal. Responsible parties will perform dredging and capping within the Gowanus Canal and upgrades to the canal bulkheads to support the dredging and capping. Cleanup work within the Canal could likely result in the continued redevelopment in the commercial and residential áreas adjacent to the Canal. The major enforcement action for FY2020 is a $125 million unilateral administrative order (UAO), issued to six potentially responsible parties on January 28, 2020, to perform the dredging and capping in the upper area of the Canal. That dredging began on Monday, November 16, 2020 and is expected to take about 30 months. In addition, eight settlement agreements, valued at $50 million, also address cleanup work to support the dredging and capping work, and a ninth agreement is a $10 million payment for the Agency’s past cleanup costs.

By addressing Superfund sites in densely populated urban areas such as the Gowanus Canal, EPA is protecting public health and the environment while supporting Brooklyn’s continued economic redevelopment.” Information about the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site The Gowanus Canal is a 100-foot wide, 1.8-mile long canal in Brooklyn, New York. The Canal is bounded by several communities, including Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and Red Hook. The Canal empties into the New York Harbor. The adjacent waterfront is primarily commercial and industrial, currently consisting of concrete plants, warehouses and parking lots. The Gowanus Canal was built in the mid-1800s and was used as a major industrial transportation route. Manufactured gas plants (MGP), paper mills, tanneries and chemical plants operated along the Canal and discharged wastes into it. In addition, contamination flows into the Canal from overflows from sewer systems that carry sanitary waste from homes and rainwater from storm drains and industrial pollutants. As a result, the Gowanus Canal has become one of the nation's most seriously contaminated water bodies. More information about the site is available on the Agency’s Gowanus Canal Superfund site profile webpage.

Information on Pollutants and Environmental Effects More than a dozen contaminants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals, including mercury, lead and copper, are present at high levels in the Gowanus Canal sediment. The cleanup plan for the Gowanus Canal Superfund site includes dredging to remove contaminated sediment from the bottom of the Canal, which has accumulated because of industrial and combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges. Following dredging, construction of a multilayer cap in dredged areas will isolate and prevent migration of any remaining chemicals in the deep native sediments. Certain areas of the native sediment, below the original canal bottom, that contain mobile liquid tar and are too deep to excavate will be mixed with cement and solidified to prevent the migration of the tar into the water of the Canal. Controls to reduce CSO discharges and prevent other land-based sources of pollution, such as street runoff, from compromising the cleanup are also included in the cleanup plan.",Answer: 135 million

66,Cleanup of Public and Residential Property at Illinois Superfund Site," In 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) completed two enforcement actions at the DePue/New Jersey Zinc/Mobil Chemical Site (Site) located in DePue, Illinois to address cleanup of contaminated soil on public and residential property. On January 23, 2020, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order (UAO) to TCI Pacific Communications, LLC (TCI) and CBS/Westinghouse of PA, Inc., for cleanup work at the site’s operable unit (OU) 4. The value of the cleanup work is $10 million. On November 6, 2020, the EPA entered into a settlement agreement with TCI and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation for the completion of a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) for the sites’ OUs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. The value of the settlement agreement is $600,000. These enforcement actions enhance the overall cleanup plan at the site, which prioritizes the cleanup of residential soils. The first phase of soil cleanup will focus on public property such as parks, athletic fields and schools. The cleanup will then move onto residential properties where contamination was found to be in exceedance of EPA standards. The current cleanup of residential soils, primarily taking place in residents’ yards and gardens, provides a direct and immediate positive impact to the community of DePue. The RI/FS activities will further identify the nature and extent of contamination and result in the final cleanup of all operable units at the site On this page: Information about the Settling Parties

	Contact",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/kp-kauffman-company-settlement,Consent Decree,2020-01-21,"Related Information Press release Consent Decree Injunctive Relief The settlement requires the following actions to resolve the alleged Clean Air Act violations: KPK must ensure that its vapor control systems are capable of capturing and routing emissions to a control device in one of two ways: (1) modify its vapor control systems by installing and operating an automated system that will control flow rates to the tank system; or (2) follow an engineering evaluation process and modify vapor control systems that do not have capacity to capture and route the vapors to the emission control device. KPK will verify proper operation of each tank system with an infrared camera inspection. KPK will evaluate the condition of all pressure relief valves, thief hatches, blowdown valves, and mountings and gaskets on each condensate storage tank to assess the need to repair, replace, or upgrade equipment and address any evidence of VOC emissions from that equipment. KPK will develop and implement a directed inspection and preventative maintenance program to ensure proper upkeep and operation of its vapor control systems and associated operations. KPK will perform monthly or quarterly infrared camera inspections (depending on the tank system’s production volume) at all tank systems subject to the settlement to detect and respond to emissions and indicia of emissions. KPK will install pressure monitors with continuous data reporting at tank systems to verify that storage tanks are not experiencing increased pressure readings indicative of tank over-pressurization and possible VOC emissions. The settlement includes measures to proactively detect recurring issues and identify and implement actions to prevent further recurrence. Each quarter, KPK will conduct a review of indicia of emissions at its tank systems to identify and address underlying and contributing causes. Additionally, KPK will conduct an annual records review of maintenance and corrective action work to identify recurrent or systemic issues and associated opportunities for improved operations. Implementation of these actions will cost an estimated $2.5 million and is expected to reduce VOC emissions from KPK’s operations by approximately 424 tons per year. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged with the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Contacts for Further Information Lauren Hammond, Senior Assistant Regional Counsel Office of Regional Counsel U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – Region 8 1595 Wynkoop Street (8ORC-R) Denver, Colorado 80202 303-312-7081hammond.lauren@epa.gov Tim Sullivan, Attorney-Advisor Air Enforcement Division Office of Civil Enforcement Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1595 Wynkoop Street (8MSU) Denver, Colorado 80202 303-312-6196sullivan.tim@epa.gov Mitigation Projects KPK will implement three environmental mitigation projects to further reduce its operations’ VOC emissions. KPK will install rod lifts at 12 oil and natural gas wells to reduce or eliminate the need to unload the well—a procedure used to increase well production during which emissions are vented to the atmosphere. KPK will use a Boreal Laser to scan for methane emissions at all well production facilities covered by the settlement, and, if necessary, will follow up with corrective actions to address observed emissions. KPK will implement the settlement’s operation and maintenance requirements, including increased inspections, at four well production facilities not covered by air pollution regulations due to their size. KPK estimates that these mitigation projects will reduce its VOC emissions by an additional 131 tons per year. Civil Penalty KPK will pay a $1 million civil penalty that will be evenly split between the United States and the State of Colorado. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Ground-level ozone can cause temporary breathing difficulty for people with asthma, airway inflammation, and even permanent scarring of lung tissue from repeated exposure. This settlement’s emissions reductions will help address the Denver-area’s ozone nonattainment status generally, as well as the visible buildup of air pollution during inversion conditions. Overview of Companies K.P. Kauffman Company, Inc. (KPK) is a privately-held oil and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. KPK operates oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities in the Denver-Julesburg Basin. This Clean Air Act case concerns KPK’s operations in an area of Colorado designated as serious nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). KPK’s Colorado operations include oil and natural gas wells and condensate storage tanks. A condensate storage tank collects liquid hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas after production from an oil and natural gas well. The liquid hydrocarbons, or condensate, are stored in tanks until transfer for sale via tank truck or pipeline. Multiple tanks sited together are called a tank battery or tank system. Vapor control systems are required at tank systems to capture and recover or combust the condensate’s hydrocarbon vapors. Improperly or inadequately designed, sized, operated, or maintained vapor control systems can lead to uncontrolled emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and may contain hazardous air pollutants such as benzene. This settlement covers 67 condensate tank systems and associated vapor control systems regulated by Colorado State Implementation Plan requirements. Violations The settlement resolves allegations made in an October 5, 2018 complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The United States and the State of Colorado’s complaint alleged that KPK violated Colorado’s Regulation 7, Section XII requirements to minimize VOC emissions from its oil and natural gas production operations in the Denver ozone nonattainment area. More specifically, the settlement resolves alleged violations of Regulation 7, Section XII requirements relating to installation, operation, maintenance, design, and sizing of vapor control systems at condensate storage tanks. These Regulation 7, Section XII requirements are incorporated into Colorado’s federally-approved State Implementation Plan. Because Colorado’s State Implementation Plan was approved by the EPA, the Section XII requirements are federally enforceable under the Clean Air Act. The settlement also resolves alleged violations of Regulation 7, Section XVII requirements to control VOC emissions from oil and gas operations, which are enforceable only by the State of Colorado. Pollutant Impacts Ozone is not emitted directly from air pollution sources. Instead, it is a photochemical oxidant formed when certain chemicals—VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx)—in the ambient air react with oxygen in the presence of sunlight. VOCs and NOx are called “ozone precursors.” Sources that emit ozone precursors are regulated to reduce ground-level ozone in the ambient air. The Denver-area is currently classified as serious nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The Denver ozone nonattainment area spans Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and parts of Larimer and Weld counties. The Denver-area’s location next to the Rocky Mountains makes it prone to temperature inversions, in which warm air traps cooler air near the ground such that pollutants do not rise into the atmosphere. These inversion conditions can lead to an unhealthy—and even visible—air pollution buildup. KPK’s oil and gas exploration and production operations emit VOCs, NOx, and other pollutants. As a result of the settlement’s injunctive relief and mitigation projects, VOC emissions from KPK’s operations will be reduced by approximately 556 tons per year. The settlement will also result in reductions of hazardous air pollutants in the Denver-area.",$1 million
68,Punch It Performance Clean Air Act Settlement," (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - On January 10, 2020, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with defendants Punch It Performance and Tuning, Michael Paul Schimmack, and other companies and individuals close to Schimmack. The United States filed a Complaint against these Defendants on June 14, 2019, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleging violations of the Clean Air Act associated with the manufacture and sale of aftermarket defeat devices. The Complaint also alleged that certain defendants fraudulently transferred assets under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act. Prior to reaching settlement, Defendants stopped manufacturing and selling all products the government alleges violate the Clean Air Act. Defendants will pay a civil penalty of $850,000 due to their limited financial ability to pay a higher penalty. In order to pay this penalty, Defendants have represented that they will sell residential real estate properties that they purchased with profits made from the manufacture and sale of defeat devices. This case resolution comes at the outset of a new National Compliance Initiative for the EPA, entitled Stopping Aftermarket Defeat Devices for Vehicles and Engines. EPA is vigorously pursuing enforcement against those who violate the defeat device and tampering prohibitions of the Clean Air Act, including recovering ill-gained profits when violators attempt to avoid paying a civil penalty for such violations. For examples of other similar civil judicial settlements, see the EPA’s recent settlements with Performance Diesel Inc. and Derive Systems.

Washington, DC 20460 (202) 564-4904tozzi.lauren@epa.gov Overview of Defendants Defendants are the following parties: Punch It Performance and Tuning LLC, D N S Enterprises of Florida, Inc., and REI Research Group, Inc. (collectively, the “Punch It Entities”); Michael Paul Schimmack, Vanessa Schimmack, and Lori Brown. Schimmack was the President of, a principal of, and sole director of Punch It Performance and Tuning and D N S Enterprises. The Punch It Entities and Schimmack manufactured and sold aftermarket products designed for use with certified motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines – primarily, diesel pickup trucks. After the EPA inspected one of these companies and notified Schimmack of potential violation of the Clean Air Act for the manufacture and sale of defeat devices, Schimmack administratively dissolved the company and led the EPA to believe that he was no longer manufacturing and selling defeat devices. Yet, Schimmack continued to manufacture and sell the same or similar products under the name of REI Research Group. Health and Environmental Benefits The Clean Air Act aims to reduce emissions from mobile sources of air pollution, including NOx. Mobile sources of air pollution contribute approximately 58% of the nation’s oxides of nitrogen emissions. EPA testing demonstrates that installing aftermarket parts can result in increased NOx emissions from mobile sources. NOx emissions pose significant health and environmental concerns. Oxides of nitrogen form when fuel burns at high temperatures. Oxides of nitrogen can travel long distances, causing a variety of health and environmental problems in locations far from their emissions source, including ozone and smog. Oxides of nitrogen also contribute to the formation of particulate matter (PM) through chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and particulate matter can cause asthma, difficult or painful breathing, and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the elderly. In addition to these health effects, particulate matter generally causes damage to, and soiling of, commonly used building materials and culturally important items such as statues and works of art. It is also a major cause of substantial visibility impairment in many parts of the United States. The key health effects categories associated with ambient particulate matter include premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma and acute respiratory symptoms including aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and increased allergenicity have also been observed. Diesel exhaust particulate matter is of special concern. The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely carcinogenic to humans. Pollutant Impacts Today’s vehicles emit far less pollution than vehicles of the past. This is made possible by careful engine calibrations, and the use of filters and catalysts in the exhaust system. Aftermarket defeat devices undo this progress, and pollute the air we breathe. The severity of the emissions impact of these devices depends on the original vehicle design, and the extent of the vehicle modifications. EPA testing has shown that a truck’s emissions increase drastically (tens or hundreds of times, depending on the pollutant) when its emissions controls are removed. Even when the filters and catalysts remain on the truck, EPA testing has shown that simply using a tuner to recalibrate the engine (for the purpose of improving fuel economy) can triple emissions of NOx. Here, Defendants’ defeat devices increased air pollution formed in the engine during combustion. They also enabled the removal of the filters, catalysts, and other emissions control systems that are necessary to treat air pollution formed in the engine before it is emitted into the ambient air. Civil Penalty PIP will pay a civil penalty of $850,000, as the company has a limited financial ability to pay a higher penalty. In order to pay this penalty, Defendants have represented that they will sell residential real estate properties that they purchased with profits made from the manufacture and sale of defeat devices. Violations The Complaint alleges five separate claims for relief. The first three claims seek civil penalties and injunctive relief for numerous violations of the defeat device prohibition in Section 203 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7524, related to the Punch It Entities’ and Schimmack’s manufacture and sale of aftermarket defeat devices. The Punch It Entities and Schimmack manufactured and sold more than 20,000 aftermarket defeat devices. These products were designed to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative elements of design that were installed on motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines by original equipment manufacturers (i.e., “car manufacturers”) in order to comply with Clean Air Act emission standards. The aftermarket products at issue include hardware components, such as straight pipes, and electronic tuning software (i.e., “tunes”) that enables the removal of filters, catalysts and other critical emissions controls. These tuning products also reprogrammed the engine’s fueling strategy to increase power, fuel economy, or both, but at the expense of higher emissions of regulated air pollutants. Defendants’ aftermarket products were designed for use with numerous models of vehicles, including vehicles manufactured by Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler. Accordingly, the EPA alleges that each act of manufacturing and each sale constitutes a violation of Section 203(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7524(a)(3)(B). The fourth and fifth claims alleged in the Complaint seek recovery, under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act, 38 U.S.C. § 3301 et seq., of the value of assets fraudulently transferred to Schimmack, his wife, and his sister. The Complaint asserts that after the EPA provided notice in 2016 of its intent to take enforcement action, the corporate defendants transferred real estate and large sums of money to one or more of the individual defendants in their personal capacities. The United States alleges these were fraudulent transfers under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act.","850,000"

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits NOX and SO2 have adverse effects on human health and the environment. NOX can cause or contribute to a variety of health problems and adverse environmental impacts, such as ground-level ozone, acid rain, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Affected populations include children and people with lung diseases such as asthma. Exposure to these conditions can cause damage to lung tissue for people who work or exercise outside. High concentrations of SO2 can affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children, and the elderly. SO2 is also a primary contributor to acid rain. Overview of Companies This settlement is with two companies, Lehigh Cement Company LLC and Lehigh White Cement Company. Lehigh Cement Company LLC is a Delaware corporation, and maintains its corporate headquarters in Pennsylvania. Lehigh Cement owns and/or operates 12 kilns at 9 cement manufacturing plants. Lehigh White Cement Company LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its corporate headquarters in Pennsylvania. Lehigh White owns and/or operates 2 kilns at 2 white cement manufacturing plants. Violations The United States alleges in its Complaint that on more than one occasion, the Lehighs failed to obtain pre-construction permits and install and operate the appropriate nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) control technology for major modifications at its cement manufacturing plants that resulted in significant emissions increases. The changes violated requirements contained in Section 165(a) of the Clean Air Act, regulations set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 52.21, and the corresponding state regulations in state implementation plans (SIPs). EPA’s regional offices in Philadelphia (Region 3), Chicago (Region 5), and San Francisco (Region 9) issued notices of violations (NOVs) for the modifications to the Evansville, PA, Mitchell, Indiana, and Cupertino, CA plants, respectively Pollutant Impacts This settlement is part of EPA’s National Compliance Initiative to control harmful emissions from large sources of pollution, which includes cement manufacturing plants, under the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review requirements. The total NOX emission reductions from the settlement are around 4,500 tons per year. The settlement will also reduce SO2 emissions by nearly 1,000 tons per year.","1,300,000"

These products were for heavy-duty diesel engines (“HDDEs”) which power some of the largest trucks on public roads. The aftermarket products sold by PDI include hardware components and electronic tuning software, known as “tunes,” that hack into and reprogram a motor vehicle’s electronic control module to alter engine performance and enable the removal of filters, catalysts and other critical emissions controls that reduce air pollution. PDI’s aftermarket products are designed for use with numerous models of HDDEs manufactured by Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, International, and Paccar for model years 1993-2020. PDI manufactured, sold, and installed parts or components for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines that bypass, defeat, or render inoperative elements of design that were installed by the vehicle or engine original equipment manufacturer to comply with CAA emission standards. Accordingly, EPA alleges that each sale constitutes a violation of section 203(a)(3)(B) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7524(a)(3)(B), and each installation by PDI which renders inoperative a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine’s device or element of design constitutes a violation of section 203(a)(3)(A) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7524(a)(3)(A).

Jackson Blvd. Chicago, IL 60604 312-886-5112chatfield.ethan@epa.gov Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The Clean Air Act aims to reduce emissions from mobile sources of air pollution, including NOx. Mobile sources of air pollution contribute approximately 58% of the nation’s oxides of nitrogen emissions. EPA testing demonstrates that installing aftermarket parts can result in increased NOx emissions from mobile sources. NOx emissions pose significant health and environmental concerns. Oxides of nitrogen form when fuel burns at high temperatures. Oxides of nitrogen can travel long distances, causing a variety of health and environmental problems in locations far from their emissions source, including ozone and smog. Oxides of nitrogen also contribute to the formation of particulate matter (PM) through chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and particulate matter can cause asthma, difficult or painful breathing, and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the elderly. The key health effects categories associated with ambient particulate matter include premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma and acute respiratory symptoms including aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and increased allergenicity have also been observed. Diesel exhaust particulate matter is of special concern. The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely to be carcinogenic to humans. In addition to these health effects, particulate matter generally causes damage to, and soiling of, commonly used building materials and culturally important items such as statues and works of art. It is also a major cause of substantial visibility impairment in many parts of the United States. Injunctive Relief The Consent Decree specifies steps PDI must take to prevent future violations. PDI may sell its products if it complies with the requirements contained in the Consent Decree. The Consent Decree contains the following injunctive relief: PDI will not manufacture, sell, offer to sell, or install on any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine any part of component, including but not limited to, tunes, software, or programming (and devices on which such tunes, software or other programming are loaded), a principal effect of which is to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative a motor vehicle emission control device of emission-related element of design absent a reasonable basis that such products do not adversely affect vehicle emissions and retain full operation and functionality of the On-Board Diagnostics System. For new tuning products, PDI will demonstrate a reasonable basis by obtaining a California Air Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order (EO) prior to manufacture, sale, offering for sale, and installation of products. For existing products not currently covered by a CARB EO, PDI will demonstrate a reasonable basis by submitting a complete application to CARB that covers the tunes prior to manufacture, sale, offering for sale, and installation. Under this consent decree, a complete application includes emission test results sufficient to satisfy CARB’s requirements for obtaining a CARB EO. PDI must also destroy or delete all products subject to the consent decree under its control, including products forfeited by employees and officers of PDI; refuse, and direct its authorized dealers to refuse, to provide technical support or other information, including marketing materials, pertaining to installation, manufacture, sale, use, or repair of any product subject to the consent decree on a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine; review and revise marketing materials; send notice to all customers and authorized dealers of products subject to the consent decree informing them of the settlement; provide notice to employees of applicable CAA prohibitions; require employees to forfeit products subject to the consent decree; conduct training for all PDI employees to ensure compliance with the Act; and submit semi-annual status reports on compliance with the CD. Civil Penalty PDI will pay a civil penalty of $1,100,000, as the company has a limited financial ability to pay a higher penalty. Pollutant Impacts Today’s vehicles emit far less pollution than vehicles of the past. This is made possible by careful engine calibrations, and the use of filters and catalysts in the exhaust system. Aftermarket defeat devices undo this progress, and pollute the air we breathe. The emissions impact depends on the original vehicle design, and the extent of the vehicle modifications. EPA testing has shown that a truck’s emissions increase drastically (tens or hundreds of times, depending on the pollutant) when its emissions controls are removed. Even when the filters and catalysts remain on the truck, EPA testing has shown that simply using a tuner to recalibrate the engine (for the purpose of improving fuel economy) can triple emissions of NOx. Here, PDI’s defeat devices increased air pollution formed in the engine during combustion. They also enabled the removal of the filters, catalysts, and other emissions control systems that are necessary to treat air pollution formed in the engine before it is emitted into the ambient air. Overview of Company Performance Diesel, Inc. (“PDI”), is a Utah corporation owned and managed by its president Jerad Wittwer. PDI’s principal place of business is in St. George, Utah. PDI also uses a warehouse in Zelienople, Pennsylvania. PDI conducts its business both from its Utah store and over the internet through its website, http://www.pdidiesel.com, selling to individual customers directly as well as to downstream retailers.","1,100,000"
76,City of Houston Clean Water Act Settlement," (Washington, DC - August 27, 2019)  In a settlement agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the city of Houston, Texas, has agreed to implement a comprehensive set of corrective measures and improvements to the city’s sewer system to resolve longstanding problems with sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and discharges into various water bodies of pollutants in excess of permitted limits from the city’s 39 wastewater treatment plants.

The city will conduct a comprehensive assessment of its sanitary sewer system to identify defective sewer pipes and lift stations in poor condition. The assessment results will be used to prioritize rehabilitation efforts aimed to prevent the occurrence of future SSOs. The city will repair or replace no less than 150 miles of sewer pipe and associated manholes and renew or replace approximately 18 lift stations annually. Houston has identified nine locations with deficient capacity to convey increases in flow through the system during wet weather. Projects to address these capacity deficiencies are to be completed within the first 10 years of the settlement. The City will also study whether discharges that occur from two permitted facilities outside of the 39 WWTPs during large storm events can meet treatment requirements imposed by the Clean Water Act. If results indicate that achieving those treatment standards is not viable, then the city must eliminate those discharges. The City of Houston will develop and implement a capacity, management, operation, and maintenance program which includes comprehensive system cleaning and a grease and root control program to minimize SSOs caused by sewer blockages. The City will also install more than 3,000 real-time sensors capable of sending alerts when conditions indicate a problem in the sewer system that may lead to an SSO. The total cost of implementing these measures is estimated to be $2 billion over the 15-year period to complete the injunctive relief.

Health and Environmental Effects Total Suspended Solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients – Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive Overview The city of Houston owns and operates one of the largest separate sewer systems in the country, consisting of 39 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and a collection system with more than 6,100 miles of sewer pipe and 383 lift stations. Violations The Complaint alleges that the City of Houston violated Section 301 of the Clean Water Act and terms and conditions of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, which set limits for how much of a certain pollutant an entity is allowed to discharge into a waterbody. Houston’s alleged violations include effluent limit exceedances, frequent discharges of raw sewage to waters of the United States and failure to prevent sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) through proper operation and maintenance of its system. Pollutant Impacts Through the implementation of the proposed Decree, the following estimated annual pollutant reductions will result: 9,468 pounds of total suspended solids; 9,063 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand; 1,471 pounds of total nitrogen; and 210 pounds of total phosphorus.","$4,400,000"

The remote monitoring devices shall monitor sewer surcharge levels and be designed to send the City real-time alerts of a likely SSO event(s) when the thresholds specified by the City are attained and/or exceeded, thereby improving the City’s sewer operations and responsiveness to SSOs, with the goal of preventing SSOs from occurring at these SSO locations. Overview of Company The City of Meridian, MS (City or Meridian) owns and operates approximately 330 miles of sewer pipes that convey wastewater and other pollutants to the City’s two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The collection system includes “sanitary sewers” (i.e., pipes that are designed to carry sewage only). The system’s service population is approximately 40,800. The City’s WWTPs discharge to Sowashee Creek, which is a major tributary of the Pascagoula River. Sowashee Creek is listed on Mississippi's 2010 and 2012 Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 303(d) list as impaired for nitrogen and phosphorus, and Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) has developed Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for Sowashee Creek to address previous Section 303(d) listed impairments; including a sedimentation TMDL and an organic enrichment/low dissolved oxygen TMDL. Civil Penalty The City will pay a civil penalty in the amount of $276,000 to the United States and the State for its violations of the CWA, to be split evenly. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Total suspended solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients - Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. Violations The Complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties and alleges three claims under the CWA and Mississippi State Law. These claims are: (1) unauthorized discharges from wastewater collection and transmission system, (2) failure to comply with permit condition - proper operation and maintenance, and (3) failure to comply with permit condition - failure to report SSOs.",No claimable amount

On August 12, 2015, EPA Region 10 issued a SSURO to Amazon that prohibited it from further distributing or selling unregistered and misbranded insecticidal chalk products. EPA issued another SSURO to Amazon on January 29, 2016, prohibiting the sale or distribution of several different unregistered and misbranded pesticide products claiming effectiveness against insect and rodent pests. After the 2016 SSURO, EPA and Amazon resolved by settlement over four thousand FIFRA violations in a Consent Agreement and Final Order (CAFO) issued on February 14, 2018. In the CAFO, Amazon agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,215,700 and agreed to fund and develop a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) to significantly reduce the number of illegal pesticides available generally to U.S. consumers through e-commerce marketplaces. Specifically, Amazon agreed to develop a publicly available online training course, downloadable educational materials, and test, about the requirements of FIFRA and its regulations. The training would be mandatory for any amazon.com sellers intending to sell pesticides (or devices regulated by FIFRA), but would be available to any member of the public, and would be published in English, Spanish and Chinese. As of the date of the June 2019 SSURO, Amazon had developed and was in the process of implementing the program.

The SSUROs also prohibit those two parties from using, selling, offering for sale, holding for sale, shipping, delivering for shipment, moving or removing for disposal from any facility or establishment, the subject products for any reason, unless approved by EPA in writing. The SSUROs shall remain in effect unless and until revoked, terminated, suspended or modified in writing by EPA. More information on the use of Stop Sale, Use, or Removal Orders. Basis for the Orders From approximately March 2018 until the issuance of the 2019 SSUROs, Region 10 reviewed information submitted by the public and collected by its own investigation of pesticide products being distributed or sold on amazon.com in violation of FIFRA; conducted several inspections of offers for sale of pesticides on amazon.com; and analyzed product samples. The information collected gave the EPA reason to believe Amazon and Sirowl had been distributing or selling, and intended to continue distributing and selling, unregistered and misbranded pesticides in violation of FIFRA. Specifically, EPA had reason to believe that on multiple occasions between November 1, 2017, and April 14, 2019, Amazon distributed and sold the following unregistered and misbranded pesticides: counterfeit Advion Cockroach Gel Bait, counterfeit Advion Ant Gel products, Bagoro Cockroach Gel Bait, HaRuion Cockroach Gel Bait, HaRuion Spa mineral sanitizer for spas, Just One Bite II Bars, FINAL Rodenticide Ready-to-Use Place Pacs, Havoc Rodenticide Bait Pack Pellets with Bitrex, and Contrac Rodenticide Ready-to-Use Place Pac. EPA also had reason to believe that on multiple occasions between the same timeframe, Sirowl distributed and sold the following unregistered and misbranded pesticides: Bagoro Cockroach Gel Bait and HaRuion Cockroach Gel Bait. Overview Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), all pesticides must be registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before being distributed or sold. “To distribute or sell” is a term defined by FIFRA to include distributing, selling, offering for sale, offering to deliver, shipping, etc. In addition to unregistered pesticides, FIFRA also prohibits the distribution or sale of pesticides that are misbranded. The term “misbranded” applies to pesticides with false or misleading labeling, pesticides offered for sale as imitations of other pesticides, pesticides with labels missing certain required information, such as the ingredient statement and appropriate directions for use, and in other scenarios. EPA has the authority under FIFRA section 13 to issue a SSURO to any person who owns, controls, or has custody of pesticides that have been or are intended to be distributed or sold in violation of FIFRA. EPA also has the authority under FIFRA section 14 to assess civil penalties to any entity that has distributed or sold unregistered or misbranded pesticides. Amazon Services, LLC, is an online retailer and distributor of millions of consumer goods, including pesticides regulated by FIFRA. Products offered for sale and purchased through amazon.com are distributed to consumers in one of three ways: by Amazon directly, by third party sellers directly, or through the “Fulfillment by Amazon” service. Sirowl Technology, LLC, is a company incorporated and located in the State of Wyoming that distributed and sold pesticides on amazon.com using the “Fulfillment by Amazon” service.","1,215,700"
82,Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Administrative Compliance Orders," On May 21, 2019, the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, through the Air Enforcement Division, Office of Civil Enforcement, issued four administrative compliance orders on consent (Orders) to the following owners/operators of coal refuse-burning electric generating units in the states of West Virginia and Pennsylvania: American Bituminous Power Partners, L.P. (Grant Town Facility), Inter-Power/AhlCon Partners L.P. (Colver Power Project), Northern Star Generation, LLC (Cambria CoGeneration Company) and Ebensburg Power Company (Ebensburg Power). The Orders address non-compliance with the acid gas provisions of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS), found at 40 C.F.R. Part 63, Subpart UUUUU. Although the recipients of the Orders report compliance with the mercury limits under MATS, they are currently not in compliance with the acid gas emission standards for hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are evaluated for these units using sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions as a surrogate for HCl. The standards applicable to these eastern bituminous coal refuse-fired units are currently under review by EPA prior to finalization in a final rule. The Orders establish enforceable SO2 emission limits for each unit and require that each unit come into compliance with MATS no later than April 15, 2020. American Bituminous Power Partners, L.P.

Mail Code 2242A Washington, D.C. 20460 Tel. 202-565-0062Meisenbach.Caitlin@epa.gov Mitigation FCA must implement a program to fully mitigate the excess NOx emissions from the vehicles. The mitigation program requires FCA to improve the efficiency of 200,000 aftermarket catalytic converters sold for use on light-duty vehicles by July 1, 2020. The State of California will implement a separate mitigation program. Overview EPA alleged that FCA installed undisclosed software functions and defeat devices in approximately 100,000 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee light-duty diesel vehicles (Model Years 2014-2016). The undisclosed software functions and defeat devices cause the vehicles’ emission control systems to perform differently, and less effectively, during certain normal driving conditions than on federal emission tests, resulting in increased emissions of harmful air pollutants. This settlement resolves EPA’s Notice of Violation issued to FCA on January 12, 2017, and the complaint filed on May 23, 2017, by the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA. The State of California is a co-plaintiff to this settlement. Defendants are FCA US LLC, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., V.M. Motori S.p.A. and V.M. North America, Inc. FCA US LLC is a vehicle manufacturer headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. FCA US LLC manufactured the vehicles, performed emission tests on the vehicles, met with EPA regulators about the vehicles, and submitted information about the vehicles to EPA. V.M. North America, Inc. and V.M. Motori S.p.A, or their corporate predecessors or successors, are now FCA subsidiaries. At the time the FCA vehicles were developed and manufactured, these companies worked on engine calibration and air emission issues related to the vehicles. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. is the corporate parent of FCA US LLC, V.M. North America, Inc. and V.M. Motori S.p.A. The day-to-day operations of FCA US LLC are managed by a team comprised of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. and FCA US LLC. Civil Penalty FCA will pay a penalty of $305,000,000 for its alleged civil violations of the Clean Air Act. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits NOx pollution contributes to the formation of harmful smog and soot, exposure to which is linked to a number of respiratory- and cardiovascular-related health effects as well as premature death. Children, older adults, people who are active outdoors (including outdoor workers), and people with heart or lung disease are particularly at risk for health effects related to smog or soot exposure. Nitrogen dioxide formed by NOx emissions can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, and may also contribute to asthma development in children. Actions to Prevent Future Violations FCA will take various measures to prevent future problems. FCA has implemented a corporate reorganization to ensure that personnel who test their vehicles for emissions compliance are organizationally separate from the personnel who design their vehicles. FCA will develop enhanced technical training on emissions certification and compliance that highlights the requirements for disclosure to EPA of software features that affect emissions control, and the prohibition on defeat devices. The company, and a third-party tester, will perform portable emission measurement system (PEMS) testing on their new diesel and gasoline vehicles, and FCA will collect emissions and operational data from a small fleet of the repaired vehicles. Lastly, an independent auditor will thoroughly assess FCA’s compliance with the corporate governance reforms. Clean Air Act Certification Requirements and Violations The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and its regulations aim to protect human health and the environment, in part, by reducing harmful emissions from mobile sources of air pollution. This CAA settlement concerns light-duty motor vehicles, which must satisfy tailpipe emission standards for certain air pollutants, including oxides of nitrogen (“NOx”). Pursuant to the CAA, the EPA administers a certification program to ensure that every vehicle introduced into United States commerce satisfies applicable emission standards. Under this program, manufacturers apply to the EPA for a certificate of conformity (“COC”) and must demonstrate in their applications that representative test vehicles meet emission standards. The EPA issues COCs to vehicle manufacturers based on these applications. A COC covers only those new motor vehicles that conform, in all material respects, to the design specifications described in the manufacturer’s application for that COC. Manufacturers are prohibited from selling any new motor vehicle in the United States unless that vehicle is covered by an EPA-issued COC. On May 23, 2017, the United States filed a complaint against FCA alleging violations of the CAA with regard to approximately 100,000 diesel vehicles sold in the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. complaint alleged that each of these vehicles contain, as part of the engine control module, at least eight software-based features that were not disclosed in FCA’s COC applications to EPA and that affect the vehicles’ emission control systems. The undisclosed software features defeat or lessen the effectiveness of the vehicles’ emission control systems during certain normal driving situations. This results in vehicles that meet emission standards in the laboratory and during standard EPA testing, but during certain normal on-road driving these vehicles emit NOx that is much higher than the EPA-compliant level. Each of these vehicles differs materially from the specifications provided to EPA in the certification applications, and thus the vehicles are uncertified, in violation of Section 203 of the Clean Air Act. One or more of the eight software-based features is a defeat device that defeats the emission control system, which is a separate violation of Section 203 of the Clean Air Act. Vehicle Repair: Reducing their Harmful Emissions The Approved Emissions Modification (AEM) is an FCA-developed software repair that is ready for installation in the vehicles pending final court approval. FCA updated vehicle software and calibrations to meet emission standards and tested Ram and Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles to prove to EPA and California that the vehicles with the installed AEM meet emission standards. EPA and California independently confirmed that the repaired vehicles with the installed AEM meet emission standards and that the vehicles perform similarly on federal emission tests and in normal driving conditions. As injunctive relief, FCA must update the vehicle software with the AEM to remove the defeat devices and modify the undisclosed software-based features that affect emissions in the vehicles, disclose all software features in the AEM that affect emissions in the vehicles, and implement corporate governance and organization reforms to minimize the likelihood of future environmental compliance violations. FCA must install the AEM in at least 85% of the U.S. vehicle fleet (“National Recall Target”) within two years of final court approval. For each percentage point by which FCA falls short of this National Recall Target, FCA must pay a civil penalty of $5.5 million to the United States. A separate California Recall Target exists for vehicles registered in California. FCA must meet the 85% California Recall Target or pay $825,000 for each percentage point by which FCA falls short of the California Recall Target. FCA must offer a broad extended warranty for vehicles once the AEM is installed. FCA must also conduct additional testing to demonstrate to EPA and California that the vehicles will meet emission standards over their full useful life. Vehicle owners and lessees will directly receive information from FCA concerning the AEM installation and monetary inducements for installation of the AEM on consumer vehicles. More information for vehicle owners and lessees is available at EcoDieselSettlement.com or by calling FCA at 1-833-280-4748.",No applicable numerical amount

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits VOCs contribute to smog and to sensory irritation symptoms, allergies and asthma, and neurological and liver toxicity. Certain VOC are also known carcinogens. NOx emissions contribute to smog as well as acid rain, particulate matter, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Through the implementation of injunctive relief at 20 natural gas processing plants, MPLX will improve air quality in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Texas, and Oklahoma. As a condition of settlement, MPLX has agreed to install and operate ambient air VOC monitoring stations near four natural gas processing plants in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas that will cost at least $2.5 million. Information gathered about the nature and extent of VOC emissions from natural gas processing plants will be shared with the public. In addition, MPLX will conduct a predictive fugitive leak monitoring study to test the efficacy of predictive computer modeling for fugitive leaks at a natural gas processing plant in Ohio, which will cost at least $75,000. If proven successful, such technology may be used by industry in the future to find and repair VOC-leaking components faster and more cost-effectively. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Violations The United States, the State of Oklahoma, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the State of West Virginia have filed a complaint against MPLX and 11 of its subsidiaries (MPLX) for violations of the Clean Air Act and analogous state air pollution control laws at MPLX natural gas processing plants in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Texas, and Oklahoma. MPLX failed to comply with multiple volatile organic compound (VOC) emission control requirements under several New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) applicable to natural gas processing plants, including failure to comply with Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) requirements, failure to control VOC emissions from pressure relief devices, and failure to comply with enclosed combustor testing and monitoring requirements. MPLX also failed to comply with the NSPS for synthetic organic chemical manufacturing distillation units and NSPS regulations applicable to MPLX’s hot oil process heaters. Pollutant Impacts When fully implemented, EPA estimates that the new controls and requirements would result in emission reductions of 1,523 tons per year of VOCs from MPLX’s natural gas processing plants.",925000

Overview of Company Evangeline Enterprises LLC (Evangeline), doing business as Evangeline Training Center, is a large concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) horse training facility located in Carencro, Louisiana. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The consent decree will lead to the reduction and eventual elimination of process wastewater and other pollutants associated with CAFOs. It was estimated that 10,500 gallons of horse washwater was generated and discharged. On an annual basis, 3,832,500 gallons of horse washwater may be eliminated. Comment Period The settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Lafayette Division, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Violations On October 19, 2017, the U.S. and LDEQ filed a complaint against Evangeline for violations of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Louisiana Environmental Quality Act (LEQA). The complaint alleges violations of CWA Section 301 for unpermitted discharges of manure and process wastewater to waters of the United States from a large CAFO with over 500 horses. The discharges flow through man-made ditches, unnamed tributaries, and the Francois Coulee before eventually flowing into the Vermilion River, a traditionally navigable water that is listed by Louisiana as water quality-impaired for nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria. The unnamed tributaries and the Francois Coulee are navigable waters within the meaning of CWA Section 502(7) and waters of the State of Louisiana under the Louisiana Environmental Quality Act. The complaint also alleges that Evangeline failed to comply with a Unilateral Administrative Order to cease ongoing unauthorized discharges at the facility, which EPA issued on July 29, 2013 pursuant to EPA’s authority under CWA Section 309(a)(3). Pollutant Impacts Pollutants associated with CAFO discharges include nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), pathogens (bacteria), and organic enrichment (low dissolved oxygen) which can contribute to water quality impairment in U.S. waters. Other potential environmental and human health risks include contamination of drinking water sources, transmission of disease-causing bacteria and parasites associated with food and waterborne diseases, fish advisories, and algal blooms. This facility has unauthorized discharges of pollutants that ultimately discharge to the Vermilion River – a surface water that has been identified by the state as water quality impaired due to bacteria (i.e., fecal coliform) and nutrients. Fecal coliform sampling results indicated extremely high numbers of fecal coliform (up to 10,000 colonies per 100 ml) in the discharges sampled by the facility and EPA.",300000

It is estimated that Aux Sable will spend $1.5 – 2 million in capital costs and $250,000-$500,000 per year in incremental operational and maintenance costs to complete the required injunctive relief at its facility. Also, to mitigate the environmental harm caused alleged noncompliance, Aux Sable has agreed to implement mitigation projects to reduce VOC and NOx emissions at locomotive switchyards located in the Chicago Ozone Nonattainment Area, which will include repowering switcher locomotives and installing switcher locomotive idle-reduction technology. Aux Sable will spend $3 million to implement these projects. Finally, Aux Sable has addressed its noncompliance with the Illinois ERMS program by purchasing from the Illinois EPA the necessary VOC emission allotments and required emission excursion compensation to cover VOC emission-allotment deficiencies for the period of 2001-2015, which totaled over $156,000. Aux Sable as also submitted to Illinois corrections to past annual emission reports.

Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Mailcode 2242A, Washington DC, 20016 (202) 564-8894palermo.mark@epa.gov Civil Penalty The proposed decree requires Aux Sable to pay a $2.7 million civil penalty. Overview of Company Aux Sable Liquid Products LP (Aux Sable) owns and operates one of the largest natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction and fractionation facilities in North America. The Facility is in Morris, Grundy County, Illinois, approximately 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Aux Sable’s Facility is capable of processing 2.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and can produce approximately 107,0000 barrels per day of NGL products. The Facility sits within an area within the Greater Chicago Metropolitan Area that is designated as nonattainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone (smog), known as the “Chicago ozone nonattainment area.” Health Effects and Environmental Benefits VOCs contribute to ground-level ozone and to sensory irritation symptoms, allergies and asthma, and neurological and liver toxicity. Certain VOCs are also known carcinogens. NOx emissions contribute to ground level ozone as well as acid rain, particulate matter, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Violations The United States has filed a complaint against Aux Sable for violations of the Clean Air Act and Illinois’ State Implementation Plan (SIP), which was established to achieve and maintain the NAAQS in the State, including the NAAQS for ground-level ozone. The complaint alleges that Aux Sable failed to comply with the Nonattainment Area New Source Review (NNSR) Rule under the Illinois SIP that is applicable to sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. When Aux Sable constructed its Facility in 1999, Aux Sable had obtained a “synthetic minor” limit in its SIP construction permit, limiting fugitive VOC emissions from equipment leaks to 12 tons per year, which would exempt Aux Sable from complying with major source requirements under the NNSR Rule. Aux Sable’s construction permit application, however, contained significant errors in its fugitive emission calculations done to support granting the synthetic minor limit, leading to a huge underestimate of VOC emissions at the Facility. Thus, Aux Sable’s Facility has exceeded the synthetic minor limit by approximately 27.5 tons per year since the Facility began operation in 2000. Aux Sable also has exceeded the 25 tons per year threshold for triggering major source requirements under the NNSR Rule, and has failed to comply with such requirements, including achieving Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtaining emission offsets. The complaint also alleges that Aux Sable has failed to comply with: (1) New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) applicable to natural gas processing facilities, including Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) requirements to limit fugitive VOC emission from leaking equipment; (2) NSPS regulations applicable to synthetic organic chemical manufacturing distillation units and reactor processes; (3) requirements under the NSPS for monitoring the presence of a pilot flame at the Facility’s two flares for the entirety of 2014; (4) requirements to obtain sufficient VOC emission allotments under the Illinois Emission Marketing Reduction System (ERMS), which is a VOC cap-and-trade program under the Illinois SIP that covers the Chicago ozone nonattainment area; (5) correct reporting of VOC emissions under the Illinois SIP’s annual emission report program; and (6) an emission limit for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) applicable to one of the Facility’s two process heaters that was established in a 2015 construction permit authorizing construction of a second fractionation unit at the Facility. Pollutant Impacts When fully implemented, EPA estimates that the new controls and requirements would result in emission reductions of approximately 18.8 tons per year of VOCs and between 42.3 to 52.3 tons per year of NOx",", achieving close to 90% VOC control efficiency and 99% NOx control efficiency at the Facility.

Inc. refineries. Previous settlements between Chevron U.S.A. and California state and local authorities after the 2012 incident required enhanced inspection and replacement of pipes susceptible to sulfidation corrosion, implementation of “integrity operating windows” to reduce risks associated with other damage mechanisms, and improved employee training related to emergency prevention and response at the Richmond Refinery. The United States’ and MDEQ’s currently proposed settlement builds on the injunctive relief pioneered at the Richmond Refinery, requiring that these improvements as well as other safeguards are being implemented at all Chevron U.S.A. Inc.. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. has estimated that it will spend approximately $150 million to replace vulnerable pipes, institute “integrity operating window” parameters and alarms for safer operation, improve corrosion inspections and training, centralize safety authority within the corporation, conduct a study on improving fired heater safety during startup, and make other safety improvements at all its domestic refineries. Background EPA’s initial investigation was spurred by an August 6, 2012 fire involving high-temperature hydrocarbons released in the Crude Unit at Chevron’s Richmond, California refinery. That fire prompted a shelter-in-place order by Contra Costa County officials, endangered 19 employees and caused 15,000 local residents to seek medical attention. During EPA’s investigation, there were accidental releases of regulated chemicals at two other Chevron refineries, including a 2013 explosion and fire in Pascagoula, Mississippi that caused the death of employee Tonya Graddy, and a 2013 rupture in El Segundo, California that caused a loss of power and significant flaring at the refinery.

Kodish Air Enforcement Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1595 Wynkoop Street (8MSU) Denver, CO 80202-1129kodish.jeff@epa.gov Mitigation NGL will purchase and retire 36 million valid biomass-based diesel RINs to offset the harm caused by its alleged violations. Civil Penalty NGL will pay a civil penalty of $25 million. The penalty is based, in part, on the company’s limited ability to pay a larger penalty. Health and Environmental Benefits In order to ensure the GHG emissions reductions from the RFS program are achieved, and to protect the program's integrity and maintain a level playing field for regulated companies, EPA pursues enforcement actions against renewable fuel producers and other parties involved in the generation of invalid RINs. Overview NGL is a midstream energy provider that transports crude oil, and markets and supplies fuel products, including some renewable fuel products. NGL is headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At the time of the violations, NGL was known as Gavilon, LLC. Overview of the Renewable Fuel Standard Program The original Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS1) was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and established the first renewable fuel volume mandate in the United States. RFS1 required 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel be blended into gasoline by 2012. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the program, which became known as the RFS2 program. The RFS2 program reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting a national mandate for renewable fuels that meet specific GHG emissions reduction standards. The RFS2 regulations created a market based program to assure that the national mandate will be met. Renewable fuel producers and importers generate renewable fuel credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs, for each gallon of renewable fuel that meets the GHG emissions reduction standards. The program requires refiners and importers, known as obligated parties, to retire a specific number of RINs each year based on the amount of petroleum fuel that they produce and import. The RFS program was designed to reduce GHG emissions by 138 million metric tons when fully implemented in 2022. The reductions would be equivalent to taking about 27 million vehicles off the road. (See: section on ""Greenhouse Gas Emissions"" in EPA Finalizes Regulations for the National Renewable Fuel Standard Program for 2010 and Beyond.) Violations The settlement resolves allegations made in an October 4, 2016, Complaint against NGL for violations of the RFS2 regulations. The EPA and the DOJ alleged that in 2011, NGL, then known as Gavilon, LLC, entered into a series of transactions with Western Dubuque, LLC that resulted in the generation of more than 36 million invalid biomass-based diesel RINs. The allegations were as follows: NGL purchased biodiesel with RINs from other companies, separated and sold the RINs to third parties, and then sold the biodiesel to Western Dubuque as a methyl ester ""feedstock."" Methyl esters are a class of chemical compounds that include, but are not limited to, biodiesel. Western Dubuque then reprocessed this ""feedstock"" and generated a second set of RINs for the reprocessed fuel. Western Dubuque sold all of the biodiesel it produced from NGL’s “feedstock” and RINs it generated in 2011 to NGL. The EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice also alleged that Western Dubuque violated a number of RFS2 regulations because the RINs it generated were not produced using a qualifying feedstock or qualifying process. The United States settled it claims against Western Dubuque on October 4, 2016. See: the Western Dubuque Biodiesel, LLC case. Pollutant Impacts Biomass-based diesel RINs represent renewable fuel that displaces petroleum diesel fuel and achieves GHG emissions reductions. When two RINs are generated for the same volume of fuel, the invalid RINs distort the actual GHG emissions achieved. This has a negative impact on the goals of the RFS program and the integrity of the RIN market. The EPA estimates that the illegal generation of RINs in this case resulted in excess greenhouse gas emissions of about 151,319 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Litigation The United States and NGL litigated the case for over a year and a half. On May 24, 2017, the Court denied NGL’s Motion to Dismiss. On July 3, 2018 the Court ruled for the United States on its claims against NGL. Specifically, the Court ruled that in 2011, NGL: failed to retire RINs when it designated the biodiesel it sold to Western Dubuque as a “feedstock.” Illegally transferred invalid RINs that Western Dubuque generated from NGL’s methyl ester “feedstock.” NGL caused Western Dubuque to commit prohibited acts. On September 27, 2018, the Court ordered the summary judgment order unsealed and publicly available. View the summary judgement order.",$25 million
93,Derive Systems Clean Air Act Settlement," (Washington, DC - September 24, 2018) - The U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with Derive Systems (Derive) addressing the sale of approximately 363,000 aftermarket products which the United States alleges were designed, in part, to defeat the emissions control systems of cars and trucks in violation of the Clean Air Act. The settlement (or Consent Decree) provides a path for compliance to allow the continued sale, purchase and use of some of Derive’s products. Specifically, the Consent Decree provides a phase-out period for certain features on existing products, and newly introduced products must meet certain standards.

Derive may sell its products if it complies with the requirements contained in the Consent Decree. Derive will spend approximately $6.25 million to implement the following injunctive relief: Some features of existing products must be discontinued to ensure that they are Clean Air Act-compliant (for example, by removing user-adjustable features that can turn off exhaust gas recirculation or rear oxygen sensors, or sensors in the onboard diagnostic system) according to a compliance schedule. For all new and existing tuners offered for sale, Derive must have a reasonable basis demonstrating that the use of the tuners will not adversely affect vehicle emissions, according to a process and schedule specified in the Consent Decree. Under the Consent Decree, one way to demonstrate a reasonable basis for a specific tuner would be to obtain an Executive Order from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Any of Derive’s products covered by a CARB Executive Order are legal for sale. The Consent Decree does not require Derive to immediately recall its products from dealers, distributors or customers. Derive will be required, however, to conduct testing of existing products, and by specified deadlines in 2019 and 2020, Derive must modify or destroy any tuners in the inventory of authorized dealers if the tuners have the above-referenced user-adjustable features. The use of these user-adjustable features to bypass, remove disable or reduce the effectiveness of exhaust gas recirculation, filters or catalysts on an EPA-certified motor vehicle has been and remains subject to EPA enforcement. Derive must limit access to key emission control parameters in the Advantage III Software and create a customer verification program for users of this software. Derive must not advertise or provide training to demonstrate how consumers can defeat emission controls in their vehicles, and work with their national distributors to prevent the sale of their products if they are packaged with companion defeat devices, such as “delete” pipes. Derive must train their employees to comply with the Clean Air Act.

Overview of Company Derive Systems, Inc. sells aftermarket products marketed under the brand names Bully Dog and SCT for many types of gasoline- and diesel-fueled motor vehicles. The products are sold either online through Derive’s website (www.derivesystems.com) or through Derive’s distribution network. Derive’s primary location is in Sanford, Florida although the company has employees in multiple locations, including Broomfield, Colorado, and Pocatello, Idaho. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The Clean Air Act aims to reduce emissions from mobile sources of air pollution, including NOx. Mobile sources of air pollution contribute approximately 58% of the nation’s oxides of nitrogen emissions. EPA testing demonstrates that certain tuners alleged to be in violation result in increased NOx emissions from mobile sources. These tuners also enable the removal of catalysts and filters, which can also increase emissions of particulate matter and further increases emission of NOx. NOx emissions pose significant health and environmental concerns. Oxides of nitrogen form when fuel burns at high temperatures. Oxides of nitrogen can travel long distances, causing a variety of health and environmental problems in locations far from their emissions source, including ozone and smog. Oxides of nitrogen also contribute to the formation of particulate matter (PM) through chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and particulate matter can cause asthma, difficult or painful breathing, and chronic bronchitis, especially in children and the elderly. The key health effects categories associated with ambient particulate matter include premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma and acute respiratory symptoms including aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and increased allergenicity have also been observed. Diesel exhaust particulate matter is of special concern. The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely to be carcinogenic to humans. In addition to these health effects, particulate matter generally causes damage to, and soiling of, commonly used building materials and culturally important items such as statues and works of art. It is also a major cause of substantial visibility impairment in many parts of the United States. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Alleged Violations Derive manufactured and sold custom tuning software called the Advantage III Software, software products known as “tunes,” and handheld devices known as “tuners” with preloaded tunes. EPA alleges that these products are designed to access and overwrite the original vehicle manufacturer’s software that was designed to reduce air pollution and comply with the Clean Air Act. Derive sold approximately 363,000 such aftermarket defeat devices over the course of many years. For example, Derive’s tunes can enable the complete removal of emission control components that reduce tailpipe emissions (including catalysts and exhaust gas recirculation systems) by rendering inoperative elements of vehicle on-board diagnostic systems. These are required elements of design in accordance with Title II of the Clean Air Act, the EPA’s regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 86, and the applicable Certificates of Conformity issued by the EPA. Derive sold parts or components for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines that bypass, defeat, or render inoperative elements of design that were installed by the vehicle or engine original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to comply with Clean Air Act emission standards. Accordingly, EPA alleges that Derive violated section 203(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7522(a)(3)(B). Pollutant Impacts Today’s vehicles emit far less pollution than vehicles of the past. This is made possible by careful engine calibrations, and the use of filters and catalysts in the exhaust system. Aftermarket defeat devices undo this progress, and pollute the air we breathe. The emissions impact depends on the original vehicle design, and the extent of the vehicle modifications. EPA testing has shown that a truck’s emissions increase drastically (tens or hundreds of times, depending on the pollutant) when its emissions controls are removed. Even when the filters and catalysts remain on the truck, EPA testing has shown that simply using a tuner to recalibrate the engine (for the purpose of improving fuel economy) can triple emissions of NOx.",300000

For the company’s three remaining furnaces, Anchor will install oxygen enriched air staging (OEAS) and meet tightened emissions limits. To control for SO2, Anchor has agreed to install dry or semi-dry scrubber systems on two furnaces, and to meet enforceable SO2 emission limits on those furnaces of 0.70 pounds of SO2 per ton of glass pulled, which is the most stringent SO2 BACT limit at any glass furnace to date. The remaining furnaces are required to achieve batch optimization and meet enforceable emissions limits. To address PM, Anchor will install two new electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to control PM emissions. All furnaces will also be subject to final emission limits, and will be required to comply with New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) requirements. Anchor will also install NOx and SO2 continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) at all furnaces, and will install PM continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS) at all furnaces subject to a COMS requirement under NSPS. Additionally, Anchor will spend $600,000 in mitigation dollars on a wood burning appliance change-out project and a diesel engine repower/retrofit/replacement project, further reducing NOx, SO2 and PM emissions. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. For more information, contact: Sara Froikin Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 290 Broadway New York, NY 10007 212-637-3263 froikin.sara@epa.gov Civil Penalty Anchor will pay a civil penalty of $1,100,000, to be divided between the United States and the two state signatories under the consent decree, Indiana and Oklahoma. Overview of Company Anchor Glass Container Corporation is headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Anchor is one of a handful of large container glass manufacturing companies in the United States. Anchor’s facilities manufacture beer bottles, liquor bottles, other beverage bottles, jars and other glass containers. Health and Environmental Benefits NOx, SO2 and PM all have adverse effects on human health and the environment, as discussed below: Nitrogen Oxides – NOx can cause or contribute to a variety of health problems and adverse environmental impacts such as visual impairment, water quality deterioration, ground-level ozone, acid rain and global warming. Affected populations include children, people with lung diseases such as asthma and people who work or exercise outside. Sulfur Dioxide – High concentrations of SO2 can affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children and the elderly. SO2 is also a primary contributor to acid deposition and visibility impairment. Particulate Matter – Particulate matter (PM), especially the fine particles, can travel deep into a person’s lungs causing coughing, decreased lung function, chronic bronchitis and even death. Sensitive populations include the elderly, children and people with pre-existing heart or lung disease. Particulate matter also contributes to haze which can affect visibility, and causes outdoor monuments and structures to become dirty. Violations The settlement resolves claims that Anchor failed to obtain pre-construction permits and install and operate the appropriate nitrogen oxide (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) control technology for major modifications at one or more of its glass manufacturing plants, resulting in significant emissions increases. The changes violated requirements contained in Section 165(a) of the Clean Air Act, regulations set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 52.21 and corresponding state regulations in state implementation plans (SIPs). Pollutant Impacts This settlement is part of EPA’s National Enforcement Initiative to control harmful emissions from large sources of pollution, which includes glass manufacturing plants, under the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review requirements. The total NOX emission reductions from the settlement are over 2,000 tons per year. The settlement will also reduce SO2 emissions by over 700 tons per year and PM emissions by over 100 tons per year. Reducing these harmful air pollutants will benefit the communities located near the Anchor plants, particularly communities disproportionately impacted by environmental risks and vulnerable populations, including children.","$ 1,100,000"

As a condition of settlement, MarkWest has agreed to install and operate ambient air monitoring stations near two compressor stations in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Information gathered about the nature and extent of VOC emissions from midstream oil and gas operations will be shared with the public. In addition, MarkWest will make available royalty-free licenses to use their proprietary pig ramp technologies developed during the enforcement investigation, and share methods for controlling emissions from pigging operations with industry. Overview of Company MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, LLC and Ohio Gathering Company, LLC are subsidiaries of MarkWest Energy Partners (collectively, MarkWest), which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. MarkWest is a subsidiary of MPLX LP, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. MarkWest and MPLX LP are engaged in the gathering, transportation, and processing of natural gas, the transportation, fractionation, marketing, and storage of natural gas liquids, and the gathering and transportation of crude oil. MarkWest has natural gas operations in the southwest, the Gulf Coast, and the northeast regions of the United States, including the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. MarkWest provides midstream services in natural gas resource operations, provides services between upstream exploration and production of natural gas, and delivers hydrocarbon products to intermediate or end-use markets, in natural gas resource operations. Pollutant Impacts When fully implemented, EPA estimates that the new controls and requirements would result in emission reductions of 706 tons per year (tpy) of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and 91.5% annual emission reductions throughout the natural gas gathering system. This case and settlement is the first to recognize and address the significant noncompliant VOC emissions associated with pigging and maintenance operations in wet gas shale plays, such as the Marcellus and Utica formations. Violations The United States and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“PADEP”) have filed a complaint against MarkWest for violations of the Clean Air Act and the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act at MarkWest compressor stations and stand-alone pigging facilities in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. “Pigging operations” are maintenance activities that are performed on a daily, weekly or monthly basis to prevent buildup of natural gas condensates in field gas gathering and transmission pipelines. These operations require a facility to vent and blowdown any pressure in the line prior to removing the device known as a pig used for the maintenance activities, including cleaning the interior of the pipeline from buildup of liquids. MarkWest failed to apply for, and comply with, the required permits and/or recordkeeping requirements under the Nonattainment New Source Review, Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs, and the Pennsylvania and Ohio State Implementation Plans, for natural gas pigging and venting activities that released excess VOC emissions.","Answer: $610,000"
102,$80 Million Mixed Funding Settlement for Lead Contamination Cleanup of Residential Properties," On April 04, 2018, a consent decree between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Doe Run Resources Corporation (Doe Run) was filed with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri to address the cleanup of approximately 4100 residential yards contaminated by lead from former mining operations at the Big River Mine Tailings/St. Joe Mineral Corp. Superfund Site in Missouri. The agreement is valued at over $80 million and involves a mixed funding arrangement where the Agency would pay for approximately 40% of specific response costs incurred by Doe Run. The operable unit (OU) being addressed by this agreement consists entirely of residential yards.

Health and Environmental Effects Approximately 7,324 linear feet of an unnamed stream was impacted by sediment deposition from within the Magnolia site to the junction where the stream enters Uchee Creek, and then into Uchee Creek. Sediment discharged from the site filled the channel of the tributary as well as the floodplain in many areas. This sediment deposition varied from twenty feet to fifty feet wide, and from one foot to six feet deep. Magnolia also buried several intermittent headwater tributaries and a small wetland, and the unauthorized fill activity impacted approximately 0.53 acres of wetlands and 935 linear feet of tributaries that eventually flow to the Savannah River 12 miles away. Overview of Company Magnolia Valley Planation, LLC, Magnolia Hills, LLC, and Magnolia Valley, LLC own a 50-acre development site located in Evans, Georgia. The Magnolia site addressed by the complaint and lodged consent decree is a residential construction site that is an expansion of an existing residential area. Pollutant Impacts Sediment-laden runoff can cause loss of in-stream habitats for fish and other aquatic life, increased difficulty in filtering drinking water, the loss of drinking water reservoir storage capacity, and a negative impact on the navigational capacity of waterways. Sediment in a receiving stream can also cause detriment to the environment by limiting the amount of sunlight to the stream and the aquatic life, inhibiting the growth of natural plants and wildlife. Dredge and fill material can also impact the health of aquatic life and the overall health of affected waters. Violations The consent decree settles alleged violations of terms and conditions of Magnolia’s Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 402 (33 U.S.C. § 1342) Georgia Construction Permit, as well as alleged violations of Section 301 of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1311, for discharge without a permit issued pursuant to Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. Magnolia’s alleged 402 permit violations include: discharge of sediment; failure to properly design and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan; failure to amend the plan as necessary; failure to properly design, implement, and maintain adequate best management practices (BMPs); failure to document and submit reports for BMP failures that resulted in sediment depositions; failure to conduct required inspections; failure to timely inspect the installation of BMPs; and failure to take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent discharges likely to have adverse effects to human health and the environment. Magnolia’s alleged 301 permit violations include discharging fill material into jurisdictional waters of the United States, including wetlands, without a 404 permit. The discharge occurred during construction activities using earth moving machinery to prepare land for residential development.","45,000 + 60,000 = 105,000"
104,EPA Issues Order for Groundwater Investigation at Mining Site in Colorado," On March 15, 2018 EPA issued a unilateral administrative order to Sunnyside Gold Corporation to conduct groundwater investigation activities at the Sunnyside Mine and surrounding area in the Bonita Peak Mining District Superfund Site in San Juan County, Colorado. Sunnyside Gold is a current owner and past operator of the Sunnyside Mine. EPA issued the order to Sunnyside Gold to conduct a remedial investigation at a portion of the site so the Agency can identify surface water impacts from the groundwater system, evaluate potential cleanup options, and assess the condition of existing bulkheads. EPA’s order requires this work to begin in 2018, with some identified items being completed by the end of the year. The company has an opportunity to request a conference with EPA to discuss the order before it becomes effective. Bottom-dwelling organisms, such as mayflies, stoneflies, or caddisflies, have been measurably impaired in approximately 30 miles of the Animas River due to natural and mining-related heavy metals concentrations in surface water. In addition, toxic metals concentrations in the Animas River below Cement Creek have eliminated virtually all fish down to Elk Creek (6 miles downstream) and all cutthroat and rainbow trout down to Cascade Creek (19 miles downstream), where only a small community of brook trout and brown trout exist. Due to natural processes, it is unlikely that Cement Creek ever supported fish communities; however, mining-related metals contamination in Cement Creek is a major source of contamination in the Animas River. The investigation ordered by EPA will help the agency form an approach to combatting these impacts on the Animas River’s ecosystem. On this page: Information about Sunnyside Gold Corporation

105,Third Party Settlement to Secure Wastewater Treatment and Remove a Barrier to New Mining Operations," On March 6, 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Justice (DOJ) entered into an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent with Bunker Hill Mining Corp. (BHMC), which is currently leasing and operating the Bunker Hill Mine in Idaho. Concurrent with this administrative settlement agreement, on March 12, 2018, EPA and DOJ lodged a consent decree with the current owner of the mine, Placer Mining Corporation (PMC). This settlement package presents an opportunity for the potential reuse of the mine that had been dormant for many years. EPA regularly incurs costs in operating a wastewater treatment plant that treats the approximately 1,300 to 1,400 gallons-per-minute of acid mine drainage released from the mine on an ongoing daily basis. If not collected and treated at the wastewater treatment plant, acid mine drainage from the mine would flow through the mine yard, across properties where public and environmental exposures would occur, and into Bunker Creek and the South Fork of the Coeur d’Alene River where it would have significant detrimental effects on water quality and the ecosystem. Under this settlement package, BHMC will pay almost $1 million annually for water treatment costs incurred by EPA, starting on December 1, 2017. Under the administrative settlement agreement, BHMC will also perform cleanup work at the mine that was previously being done pursuant to two unilateral administrative orders issued by EPA to the current owner, PMC. These are actions that BHMC is not otherwise responsible or liable for because BHMC had not caused or contributed to the existing contamination at the site. BHMC will continue to pay EPA for the wastewater treatment costs for so long as BHMC leases, owns, or occupies the Mine and until BHMC finds alternative means to treat the wastewater discharged from the mine. In addition to carrying out the cleanup actions and paying wastewater treatment costs, BHMC will pay EPA up to $20 million in satisfaction of EPA’s past costs claim against PMC. This amount is being paid by BHMC, on behalf of PMC, as a portion of the lease/purchase price between the two companies. Currently, EPA has approximately $24 million in outstanding, recoverable past costs at the site. On this page: Information about Bunker Hill Mining Corp.

Information About the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Superfund Site The Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Superfund Site, is located in northern Idaho, in one of the largest historical mining districts in the world. The site is one of the nation’s largest and most complex Superfund sites. Mining operations began in the area in 1883 and continue today. The region was mined for silver, lead, and zinc. Cleanup at the site, which spans approximately 1,500 square miles, has been ongoing since the 1980s. The settlement agreement with BHMC involves the Bunker Hill Zinc, Lead and Silver Mine, which is located within Operable Unit (OU) 02, the non-populated area of the site. Cleanup remedies selected for OU2 include a centralized wastewater treatment facility or central treatment plant (CTP), offsite disposal, drainage/erosion control, leachate control, and monitoring. In November 1994, federal and state governments assumed operation of the CTP for ongoing treatment of acid mine drainage. Currently, EPA owns the CTP. Acid mine drainage is generated and discharged from the mine continuously, and is treated through the CTP. Contaminants of concern are primarily heavy metals, including: arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc.

The training will be available to the public and online marketers in English, Spanish and Chinese. Successful completion of the training will be mandatory for all entities planning to sell pesticides on Amazon.com. Civil Penalty Amazon will also pay an administrative penalty of $1,215,700 as part of the consent agreement and final order entered into by Amazon and EPA’s regional office in Seattle, Washington. Health Effects & Environmental Benefits Non-English speaking members of the public are at increased risk from these pesticides that are illegal in the U.S. but have long been used throughout Asia. These populations’ familiarity with these products make it more likely they will order them from online sources such as Amazon. By removing such products from Amazon’s online platform and by educating third party sellers on the hazards of these unregistered and misbranded pesticide products, this agreement will decrease the availability of these unsafe products and protect these vulnerable groups.

Washington, DC 20460-0001 (202) 564-4033hellyer.yvette@epa.gov Overview of Company Amazon Services LLC (Amazon) is a world-wide company that sells a wide variety of goods and services, including pesticide products. Amazon offers a service called “Fulfillment by Amazon” whereby products are listed on the Amazon.com website for sale by third-party sellers, stored in Amazon’s fulfillment centers, and packed and shipped by Amazon. Under this system, Amazon was distributing pesticide products, which is an activity that is regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Rodenticide, and Fungicide Act (FIFRA). Pollutant Impacts As unregistered pesticides, these products have not been evaluated by EPA and can be dangerous to use. The active ingredients in these products can harm human health if the products are misapplied. Insecticidal chalk is considered to be especially hazardous to children as it mimics coloring chalk. Violations Using its fulfillment service, Amazon was illegally distributing unregistered and misbranded pesticide products that were sold and produced by companies outside the United States. Pesticide products that are sold or distributed without a valid EPA registration (other than certain minimum risk products that are exempt from registration) are referred to as illegal pesticides. The distribution or sale of unregistered or misbranded pesticides is a violation of FIFRA. These products included: “3pcs Cockroach Bugs Ants Roach Kills Chalk”, “Miraculous Insecticide Chalk”, “HUA Highly Effective Cockroach Killer Bait Powder”, “R.B.T.Z. Safe Highly Effective Roach Killer Bait Powder Indoor”, and “Green Leaf Powder Fly Killing Bait.” On August 12, 2015, EPA issued a stop sale order against Amazon that prohibited it from further distributing or selling these products. EPA issued a second stop sale order against Amazon in January 2016 after discovering additional unregistered or misbranded insecticide bait products were being offered for sale on Amazon.com. In response to these enforcement actions, Amazon immediately removed the products from the marketplace, prohibited foreign sellers from selling pesticides, and cooperated with EPA during its subsequent investigation. This enforcement action by EPA prompted Amazon to more aggressively monitor its website for illegal pesticides. This resulted in a robust compliance program comprised of a sophisticated computer-based screening system backed-up by numerous, trained staff.","1,215,700"

Shell Chemical LP is the entity that owns and/or operates the chemical plant. Shell Chemical LP is one of the largest petrochemical manufacturers in the world, producing over 20 billion pounds of chemicals annually, which are sold primarily to industrial markets in the United States. Its corporate headquarters is located in Houston, Texas. The settlement involves the reduction of air pollution from four industrial flares at the Norco facility. A flare is a mechanical device, ordinarily with a flame elevated high off the ground, used to combust waste gases that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere during certain industrial processes. Shell’s Norco facility is located approximately 20 miles northeast of New Orleans. The facility manufactures ethylene, propylene, and butadiene to sell to other manufacturers for use in the production of antifreeze, tires, plastic food containers, trash bags, laundry detergent, cosmetics, adhesives, coatings, and hundreds of other consumer and industrial materials and products. The facility operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Pollutant Impacts Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides (NOx) can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Volatile Organic Compounds – Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Benzene – Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidences of leukemia have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene. EPA has classified benzene as a Group A human carcinogen. Violations The complaint alleges that Shell Chemical violated Clean Air Act (CAA) and regulatory requirements, which resulted in excess emissions of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) including benzene, and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The allegations include violations of: New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD) and Minor New Source Review, 40 C.F.R.

Civil Penalty The city will pay a civil penalty in the amount of $55,000 to the United States and the State of Ohio for its violations of the CWA, to be split evenly. Health and Environmental Effects Total suspended solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients - Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. Overview of Company The City of Middletown, Ohio owns and operates approximately 342 miles of sewer pipe that convey sewage and other pollutants to the wastewater treatment plant. The collection system includes combined sewers (i.e., pipes that carry both sewage and stormwater in the same pipe) and sanitary sewers (i.e., pipes that are designed to carry sewage only). Middletown discharges wastewater containing pollutants from Middletown’s wastewater treatment plant to the Great Miami River. Middletown also discharges wastewater containing pollutants through eight combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfalls to the Great Miami River. The system’s service population is approximately 52,000. Pollutant Reductions Through the implementation of the consent decree, the following estimated annual pollutant reductions will result: 285,149 pounds of total suspended solids; 44,033 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand; 942 pounds of total nitrogen; and 4,009 pounds of total phosphorus. Violations The complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties and alleges four claims under the CWA and the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law.

These laws aim to reduce emissions from mobile sources of air pollution by, amongst other things, reducing emissions from fuel used in motor vehicles, nonroad vehicles, and engines and ensuring that fuel used in motor vehicles, nonroad vehicles, and engines does not harm the emissions control technology necessary to meet emissions standards. In this case, non-compliance with the CAA fuel standards resulted in additional emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the non-compliant gasoline. VOCs are a precursor to the formation of ground-level ozone. Ground-level ozone causes a wide variety of health and environmental impacts, including temporary breathing difficulty for people with asthma, respiratory illness, and aggravation of existing heart disease.

Civil Penalty The City will pay a civil penalty in the amount of $135,000 to the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for its violations of the CWA. Health and Environmental Effects Total suspended solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients - Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. Overview of Companies The City of Lancaster, PA (City) owns and operates approximately 88 miles of combined sewer pipes and 60 miles of separate sanitary sewer pipes, five combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfalls on the Conestoga River, a wastewater treatment plant known as the Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), eight pump stations, manholes, and associated appurtenances. Thirteen tributary municipalities convey their wastewater to Lancaster’s WWTP for treatment and subsequent discharge to the Conestoga River. The system’s service population is approximately 130,000. Pollutant Reductions Through the implementation of the Consent Decree, the following estimated annual pollutant reductions are expected to result: 558,596 pounds of total suspended solids; 27,511 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand; 15,747 pounds of total nitrogen; and 20,660 pounds of total phosphorus. Violations The complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties and alleges four claims under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, Act of June 22, 1937, P.L. 1987, as amended (Clean Streams Law), specifically Sections 601 and 604 of the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. §§ 691.601 and 695.605. These claims are: (1) failure to develop and implement an adequate long-term control plan (LTCP); (2) failure to comply with NPDES permit effluent limitations, (3) failure to comply with NPDES permit conditions regarding implementation of the nine minimum controls; and (4) unauthorized discharges into navigable waters, including sanitary sewer overflows. Supplemental Environmental Project The City will spend between $1.8 and $2.3 million on a supplemental environmental project involving the daylighting and restoration of a segment of Groff’s Run that is intended to restore approximately 1,350 linear feet of urban stream channel, reconnect wetlands to the Conestoga River, and establish additional habitat for micro- and macro-biota, thereby enhancing water quality.

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits NOx is a major contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone. The settlement will benefit public health because ozone exposure causes a range of human pulmonary and respiratory health effects, including chest pain, coughing, and shortness of breath. In addition to ground-level ozone, the secondary impacts of NOx include the formation of particulate matter, acid rain, and eutrophication of coastal waters. Therefore, reduction in NOx emissions has benefits to both public health and the environment and may assist the states in meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter. Overview of Company Husqvarna AB is a Swedish company, with its principle place of business in Huskvarna, Sweden. Husqvarna Consumer Outdoor Products N.A., Inc., a subsidiary of Husqvarna AB, is a domestic company with a principle place of business in Charlotte, North Carolina. Husqvarna AB and Husqvarna Consumer Outdoor Products N.A., Inc., is the largest U.S. manufacturer of handheld equipment containing small, spark-ignited nonroad engines, such as leaf blowers and chainsaws. Pollutant Impacts Husqvarna relinquished emissions credits representing nearly 1,700 tons of nitrous oxides plus hydrocarbons. These credits will not be available for future use by Husqvarna or other manufacturers. Husqvarna’s recently instituted quality control procedures and improved product mix should also reduce emissions from future products. Violations EPA administers a certification program to ensure that small, spark-ignited nonroad equipment used in the U.S. meets applicable emissions standards. Manufacturers of such equipment must test prototypes of each model (engine family) to ensure that each model does not exceed a self-selected emissions limit, or “family emissions limit,” and EPA issues a certificate of conformity. If the selected emissions limit for an engine family is below the maximum allowable limit, manufacturers can generate emissions credits which may be used to allow other current or future models to emit more than they otherwise would be allowed to emit. In order to ensure that the equipment that is actually produced and sold meets the emissions limit of the tested prototype, EPA requires that equipment coming off the assembly line be tested in specified numbers and according to a specified method. If, on average, the tested equipment does not meet the family emissions limit, the manufacturer must raise the family emissions limit. For some production engine families Husqvarna did not test enough engines, test in the correct manner, account for failed tests or retests, or raise its family emissions limit. In a separate violation, Husqvarna did not finish securing its certificate of conformity for one engine family of chainsaws.","Answer: 2,850,000"

Exxon Mobil Corporation is a publicly traded company headquartered in Irving, Texas. The settlement involves the reduction of air pollution from petrochemical and chemical flares. A flare is a mechanical device, ordinarily with a flame elevated high off the ground, used to combust (burn) waste gases that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere during certain industrial processes. The settlement covers 26 Exxon flares at two types of facilities: Olefins Plants. The primary products of these plants are two types of olefins: ethylene and propylene. Ethylene is a feedstock used in the production of consumer plastic products such as garbage bags, bread wrappers, packaging, and wire insulation. Propylene is also a feedstock used to create products such as carpet, upholstery, boats, and car parts. The following olefins plants are subject to this settlement: Baton Rouge Chemical Plant Baytown Chemical Plant Baytown Olefins Plant Beaumont Chemical Plant Polymer Plants. The primary products of these plants are different grades of a polymer known as polyethylene. Polyethylene is the feedstock in creating consumer products such as food containers/packaging, carpet backing, diapers, pipe, truck bed liners, and shipping crates. Polyethylene is the most common plastic in the world. The following polymer plants are subject to this settlement: Baton Rouge Plastics Plant Baton Rouge Polyolefins Plant Beaumont Polyethylene Plant Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant Pollutant Impacts Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs, along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Benzene - Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidences of leukemia have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene. EPA has classified benzene as a Group A human carcinogen. Particulate Matter – PM, especially fine particles, contain microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. PM is linked to a variety of problems, including increased respiratory symptoms such as irritation of the airways, coughing, or difficulty breathing, decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease. Violations The complaint alleges that Exxon violated Clean Air Act (CAA) and regulatory requirements, which resulted in excess emissions of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) including benzene. The allegations include violations of: New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (NSR/PSD) and Minor New Source Review, 40 C.F.R. Parts 51 and 52 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts A, VV, DDD, and NNN. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), 40 C.F.R. Part 61, Subparts A, J, V, and FF. NESHAP, 40 C.F.R. Part 63, Subparts A, F, G, H, YY, and FFFF. Title V and the Title V permits at Exxon’s facilities Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements Federal SEP Exxon will perform a federal supplemental environmental project (SEP) by planting trees in the City of Baytown. These trees will provide a natural buffer to reduce the transport of airborne pollutants from Exxon’s chemical plants into nearby communities. The settlement also requires Exxon to perform two state beneficial environmental projects, which are similar to SEPs, and that will benefit Louisiana.","$2,500,000"
117,"PDC Energy, Inc., Clean Air Act Settlement"," (Washington, D.C. – October 31, 2017) - EPA, the Department of Justice, and the State of Colorado today announced a settlement with PDC Energy, Inc., that will comprehensively identify and address issues with vapor control systems at PDC’s condensate storage tank batteries. The tank batteries are all located in a region that has not met EPA’s national air quality standards for ground-level ozone. In addition to implementing measures that will ensure its vapor control systems in this area are properly designed, sized, operated, and maintained, PDC has agreed to perform significant environmental mitigation projects at many of its well pads. When fully implemented, the settlement is expected to reduce harmful air pollution by more than 2,025 tons per year. Overview

Following the engineering evaluations, PDC must make any necessary modifications to ensure each vapor control system is properly designed and sized. PDC will also perform an initial evaluation of the condition of all pressure relief valves, thief hatches, and mountings and gaskets on each condensate storage tank and address any evidence of VOC emissions from those devices. Following these actions, PDC will perform infrared camera inspections to ensure that the vapor control systems are controlling emissions and the tanks are not emitting VOCs. PDC’s third-party engineering evaluations of the vapor control systems, and resulting modifications, will be verified by an in-house PDC engineer. PDC will develop and implement a directed inspection and preventative maintenance program to ensure proper upkeep and operation of the vapor control systems and associated operations. PDC will perform periodic infrared camera inspections at all tank systems to detect and respond to emissions on a frequency ranging from monthly to semi-annually, depending on total tank battery emissions (before controls). PDC will install pressure monitors with continuous data reporting on a cross-section of tank systems to verify that storage tanks are not experiencing increased pressure readings indicative of tank over-pressurization and possible VOC emissions. In addition to responding to emissions, the settlement includes measures to proactively detect recurring issues and identify and implement opportunities to prevent further recurrence. Where a tank system has recurring indicia of possible emissions in a given time period, PDC will conduct a review in an attempt to identify and address underlying and contributing causes so as to proactively prevent further recurrence. Additionally, PDC will conduct an annual records review of maintenance and corrective action work to identify recurrent or systemic issues and associated opportunities for improved operations. Implementation of these actions will cost approximately $18 million and is estimated to result in the reduction of more than 1600 tons per year in VOC emissions. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, is subject to a 30-day public comments period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice website. Civil Penalty PDC will pay a $2.5 million civil penalty divided as follows: $1.25 million to the United States; and $1.25 million to the State of Colorado, with up to $1 million of the state’s share being directed to state-only supplemental environmental projects. Contact Information Jessica Portmess, Attorney Regulatory Enforcement Unit Legal Enforcement Program U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – Region 8 1595 Wynkoop Street (8ENF-L) Denver, CO 80202 303-312-7026portmess.jessica@epa.gov Virginia Sorrell, Attorney Air Enforcement Division Office of Civil Enforcement U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1595 Wynkoop Street (8MSU) Denver, CO 80202 303-312-6669sorrell.virginia@epa.gov Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Ground-level ozone can cause temporary breathing difficulty for people with asthma, airway inflammation, and even permanent scarring of lung tissue from repeated exposure. This settlement’s emissions reductions will help address the Denver-area’s ozone moderate nonattainment status generally, as well as the visible buildup of air pollution during inversion conditions. Overview of Company PDC is an oil and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. PDC’s operations span the Wattenberg Field in Colorado, the Delaware Basin in West Texas, and the Utica Shale in Ohio. This case only concerns PDC’s operations in Colorado. PDC’s Colorado operations include oil and gas wells and condensate storage tanks. A condensate storage tank collects liquid hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas after production from an oil and gas well. The liquid hydrocarbons, or condensate, are stored in tanks until transfer for sale via tank truck or pipeline. Multiple tanks sited together are called a tank battery. Vapor control systems are required at tank batteries to capture and recover or combust the condensate’s hydrocarbon vapors. Multiple tank batteries can be served by the same vapor control system, which is designed to prevent uncontrolled vapors from being released into the atmosphere. Improperly or inadequately designed, sized, operated, or maintained vapor control systems can lead to uncontrolled emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and may contain hazardous air pollutants such as benzene. This settlement covers approximately 650 tank batteries and associated vapor control systems, which represent essentially all of PDC’s vapor control systems in the nonattainment area operating pursuant to Colorado State Implementation Plan requirements. Mitigation Projects PDC will implement the following environmental mitigation projects that will reduce ozone precursor emissions – VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – by an estimated combined total of 425 tons per year: Loading condensate from certain PDC storage tanks into tanker trucks in a closed system consisting of pipes and hoses designed to prevent vapors from being emitted to the atmosphere; and Installing and operating an emissions control package on certain natural gas-fueled compressor engines that PDC owns and operates within the nonattainment area. Implementation of these projects will cost $1.7 million. Pollutant Impacts Ozone is not emitted directly from air pollution sources. Instead, it is a photochemical oxidant formed when certain chemicals – VOCs and NOx – in the ambient air react in the presence of sunlight. VOCs and NOx are called “ozone precursors.” Sources that emit ozone precursors are regulated to reduce ground-level ozone in the ambient air. The Denver-area is currently classified as moderate nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The nonattainment area spans Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and parts of Larimer and Weld counties. The Denver-area’s location next to the Rocky Mountains makes it prone to temperature inversions, in which warm air traps cooler air near the ground such that pollutants do not rise in the atmosphere. These inversion conditions can lead to an unhealthy – and even visible – air pollution buildup. PDC’s oil and gas exploration and production operations emit VOCs, NOx, and other pollutants. As a result of the consent decree’s injunctive relief and mitigation projects, the following emissions reductions will be achieved: VOCs: Greater than 1,800 tons per year; and NOx: An estimated 225 tons per year. Violations The settlement resolves alleged violations of Colorado’s Regulation 7, Section XII requirements for controlling VOC emissions from oil and gas operations. The 2008 version of the Section XII requirements was incorporated into Colorado’s federally-approved State Implementation Plan. Colorado’s State Implementation Plan is federally enforceable under the Clean Air Act. The settlement resolves alleged violations of Regulation 7, Section XII requirements relating to operation, maintenance, design, and sizing of vapor control systems at condensate storage tanks. The settlement also resolves liability to the State of Colorado for alleged violations of state-only regulations aimed at controlling VOC emissions from oil and gas operations.","2,500,000"
118,EPA’s Lead-based Paint Enforcement Helps Protect Children and Vulnerable Communities," WASHINGTON  – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced 127 federal enforcement actions completed over the last year to protect the public, especially young children, from exposure to lead in paint.  Of these cases, 125 involved alleged noncompliance with at least one of the Agency’s lead-based paint requirements: the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule, and Lead-based Paint Activities Rule; and the Lead Disclosure Rule pursuant to the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act.  Two additional settlements resolved alleged Clean Air Act violations wherein companies committed to perform voluntary lead-based paint abatement projects. From October 2016 through September 2017, EPA filed 123 civil lead-based paint administrative actions: 120 settlements and 3 outstanding civil Complaints.  Also, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), in collaboration with EPA, obtained a guilty plea in a criminal prosecution and a Consent Decree in a civil case.  Several cases resulted from referrals by state and local authorities; and complaints from consumers and other companies.  Collectively, these settlements obtained $1,046,891.   EPA reduced the penalty in several cases, under pilot penalty programs for very small lead-based paint businesses.  EPA waived a $1.4 Million penalty where an entity satisfied all the conditions of EPA’s self-disclosure and new owner audit policies.  In five lead-based paint settlements, the violator agreed to fund a voluntary lead-based paint abatement Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP), such as window replacement, to eliminate lead risks.  Moreover, EPA and DOJ obtained abatement SEPs in two Clean Air Act enforcement actions.  Collectively, the SEPs are valued at $2,406,734.  Also, in several cases, violators agreed to perform injunctive relief or other measures beyond regulatory requirements.

Children six years old and younger are most at risk. If not detected early, children with high levels of lead in their bodies can suffer from: Damage to the brain and nervous system Behavior and learning problems, such as hyperactivity Slowed growth Hearing problems Headaches Anemia In rare cases of acute lead poisoning from ingestion of lead, seizures, coma and even death. Lead can accumulate in our bodies over time, where it is stored in bones along with calcium. During pregnancy, lead is released from bones as maternal calcium is used to help form the bones of the fetus. This is particularly true if a woman does not have enough dietary calcium. Lead can also be easily circulated from the mother's blood stream through the placenta to the fetus. Mothers with high levels of lead in their bodies can expose their developing fetuses, resulting in serious and developmental problems including: Miscarriages, Premature births or low birth weight, Brain damage, decreased mental abilities and learning difficulties, and/or Reduced growth in young children.

119,EPA Transfers Cleanup Oversight to Florida for cleanup of former phosphate mining sites," In October 2017, oversight of the cleanup work at the Coronet Industries, Inc. Superfund Alternative Site, was transferred from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The EPA and the FDEP agreed to transfer oversight of the cleanup work to support state regulatory consistency in the cleanup of former phosphate mining sites located in Florida. The cleanup will be conducted by Hexion Inc., CEMEX Construction Materials Florida LLC, and Coronet Industries, Inc., under a state cleanup agreement. Three agreements were negotiated to complete the transfer of the oversight work from the EPA under CERCLA to the state of Florida, including an administrative settlement for the recovery of past costs in which the parties agreed to pay the EPA $1.9 million.

Information about the Coronet Industries Inc. Superfund Alternative Site The Coronet Industries Inc. Superfund Alternative Site is located east of Plant City, Florida, and includes a 980-acre parcel, a 1,365-acre parcel and a handful of smaller parcels occupied by operating businesses. The site also includes a former phosphate ore mine and chemical plant. The Coronet Phosphate Company (separate from Coronet Industries, Inc.) began mining operations at the site in 1906 and conducted phosphate mining operations on portions of the site until about 1940. The company deposited mining wastes that contained smaller particles of phosphate rock, sand and clay on several areas at the site, including the land surface, pond bottoms and construction sub-base. EPA did not list the site on the NPL, but considers it an NPL-caliber site and is addressing the site through the Superfund Alternative Approach. This approach uses the same investigation and cleanup process and standards used for sites listed on the NPL. Portions of the site are currently being used for such business as cattle grazing. Parties are evaluating redevelopment opportunities for additional future use. More information on the site is available from the Coronet Industries Plant City, FL site profile page. Overview of the Agreements Pursuant to a 2007 agreement with EPA, Coronet Industries conducted a Remedial Investigation (RI) to characterize the nature and extent of contamination and potential risks posed by the site. The RI Report was approved by EPA in December 2013, and thereafter the agreement was modified to limit the work requirement to the RI in furtherance of the transfer of the site to the state. To implement the transfer, three agreements were negotiated: To meet EPA’s conditions for transfer, the final state cleanup agreement includes financial assurance requirements and a technical assistance plan (TAP) provision providing a qualified community group up to $50,000 for technical assistance.

Also, Starkist will identify and eliminate illicit connections between the facility’s industrial processes and stormwater outfalls at the facility and will obtain permit coverage under EPA’s Multi-Sector General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Industrial Activity. Starkist has made many improvements to its facility to prevent the release of hazardous substances and improve the safety of its workers and the surrounding community. Starkist upgraded its refrigeration system to safeguard against releases of ammonia, discontinued using chlorine gas to disinfect tuna thaw water, and discontinued filling butane tanks at the facility. Also, to address the self-disclosed violations, Starkist instituted a used oil program, applied for proper permits under the CAA NESHAP requirements, and filed the appropriate EPCRA forms with local responders. Starkist has also agreed to develop and implement an environmental management system, perform annual multi-media environmental compliance audits, and conduct environmental training for employees. Comment Period The settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. A summary of the settlement will be available in Samoan on that website.

Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW (MC 2243A) Washington, DC 20460 (202) 564-7039raack.melissa@epa.gov Civil Penalty Starkist will pay a $6.5 million civil penalty. The United States will receive $3.9 million and the Territory of American Samoa will receive $2.6 million. Health and Environmental Effects Starkist’s discharge of excess nutrients (total nitrogen, ammonia, and phosphorus) in alleged violation of the CWA contributes to nutrient loading in Pago Pago Harbor. Reducing nutrients from entering Pago Pago Harbor through the injunctive relief required in this settlement will help reduce nutrient pollution and coastal acidification harmful to coral and other marine life. Also, Starkist’s failure to operate and maintain its ammonia, butane, and chlorine systems in compliance with the CAA’s General Duty Clause endangers the safety of Starkist’s workers and the community. Through the settlement Starkist is taking measures, such as eliminating the use of chlorine gas, to greatly reduce the risk of a release of hazardous substances. The injunctive relief required by the settlement will prevent harm to Starkist’s workers and the community. Overview of Companies Starkist Samoa Co. owns and operates a tuna processing facility located near Pago Pago Harbor in the village of Atu'u on the Island of Tutuila in the U.S. Territory of American Samoa. Tutuila is the largest and most populous of the five islands in American Samoa. Starkist Samoa Co. is a wholly owned subsidiary of StarKist Co. The facility processes and cans tuna for human consumption, and also processes fish by-products into fishmeal and fish oil. StarKist Co. is also an operator of the facility and manages, directs, and controls environmental compliance and other decisions at the facility. StarKist Co. is a subsidiary of the Korean company Dongwon Industries. StarKist Co. is the world’s top supplier of canned tuna; the company’s products are marketed to food retailers and foodservice operators worldwide. Pollutant Reductions EPA estimates that upon full implementation of the wastewater treatment system upgrades, Starkist’s discharge of pollutants to Pago Pago Harbor will be reduced by the following amounts (pounds): Ammonia: 500,795 Total Nitrogen: 2,056,775 Total Phosphorus: 553,340 Oil and Grease: 2,845,540 Total Suspended Solids: 8,168,335 EPA estimates that upon full implementation of the stormwater injunctive relief, Starkist’s discharge of pollutants to Pago Pago Harbor will be reduced by the following amounts (pounds): Biological Oxygen Demand: 2,190 Chemical Oxygen Demand: 5,225 Nitrogen: 39 Total Suspended Solids: 1,877 Violations The settlement outlined here modifies a September 12, 2017 settlement with Starkist to resolve additional environmental issues at the tuna processing facility in American Samoa. The violations alleged in the governments’ amended complaint include ongoing exceedances of CWA permit limits, resulting in inadequately treated wastewater being discharged into Pago Pago Harbor. In addition, the amended complaint alleges that Starkist discharged storm water associated with industrial activities from storm pipes to Pago Pago Harbor without a CWA permit. Starkist failed to have proper containment for its above ground storage tanks, and properly implement a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan, as required by the CWA. Starkist also allegedly violated the General Duty Clause of the CAA, Section 112(r), when it failed to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the facility’s ammonia, butane, and chlorine systems. Finally, Starkist self-disclosed, under EPA’s Audit Policy, violations of the CAA’s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), the used oil provisions of RCRA, and the community notification requirements of EPCRA. Supplemental Environmental Project Starkist will implement a supplemental environmental project as part of the settlement. The project is the purchase and donation of emergency response equipment to local responders in American Samoa, at a cost of $88,000.",$6.5 million
121,Settlement Clears Way for Purchase and Cleanup of Mine Tailing Piles," In September 2017, Caldera Mineral Resources (Caldera) signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (ASAOC) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and purchased the Camp Bird Mine in Colorado. The settlement facilitates the sale of the Camp Bird Mine and provides for several million dollars of work at the site. Currently, EPA is negotiating removal cleanup work with Caldera Mineral Resources, Inc., the purchaser of the Camp Bird Mine out of a bankruptcy estate. Prior to the bankruptcy, Caldera leased the Camp Bird Mine in September 2012. EPA is working closely with state counterparts, including the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (CDRMS) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). This case promotes redevelopment by enabling a mining company to mine the Camp Bird Mine for the first time since the late 1980s, while protecting human health and the environment. Work will be conducted in two phases: Caldera is performing Phase 1 as an EPA Time-Critical Removal Action under the direction of a Federal On-Scene Coordinator and is addressing erosion and erosion potential at the historic tailings. Caldera can elect to perform Phase 2 under the direction of CDRMS through modification of the existing mining permit and will address erosion and erosion potential at the modern tailings. If Caldera does not elect to perform Phase 2 under the direction of CDRMS, Caldera will perform Phase 2 under the direction of a Federal On-Scene Coordinator.

Mining activities began at the Camp Bird Mine in 1877 when the first claims were staked. Silver was discovered the following year. The Camp Bird Mine produced about 1.5 million troy ounces of gold and 4 million troy ounces of silver from 1896 to 1990. Miners deposited large quantities of tailings in cells that border Sneffels, Imogene and Canyon Creeks, which ultimately combine and flow downstream to Ouray. The Site contains three very large tailings piles that are being actively eroded by three different streams (Sneffels Creek and Imogene Creek enter the Site and combine in the middle of the tailings to form Canyon Creek). All three tailings piles are also susceptible to flood events, increased runoff and failure of the existing slopes. Uncovered mine waste deposits are actively eroding into Canyon Creek, which, in turn, are loading significant amounts of heavy metals into the stream system. Concentrations of copper, zinc and lead in the mine waste deposits at the site are at levels toxic to aquatic life. An uncontrolled release of hazardous substances threatens the creek’s benthic invertebrate community and could post a threat to fish. There is a potential that the erosion may dramatically increase due to increased runoff, streamflow, or the mass failure of existing slopes. More information about the Camp Bird Mine is available from the On-Scene Coordinator site page at https://response.epa.gov/site/site_profile.aspx?site_id=9930. Background Information On Bankruptcy Proceedings Camp Bird Colorado, Inc. (CBCI) acquired the mine in 1958 and owned and operated the mine for over 50 years. CBCI applied for and obtained a mining permit from the predecessors of DRMS in 1982. CBCI undertook reclamation of the tailings cell located on the north side of Sneffels and Canyon Creeks, placing cover materials on the top and slopes of the tailings piles. In 2014, CBCI along with its parent corporation, Federal Resources Corporation, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2016. In late 2016, Caldera expressed an interest in acquiring the mine from the CBCI bankruptcy estate in settlement of its claims against CBCI. Prior to CBCI’s bankruptcy filing, Caldera acquired rights in the Camp Bird Mine under lease agreements that included purchase options. In the bankruptcy proceeding, Caldera asserted substantial secured claims against the bankruptcy estate. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee, Caldera, and the EPA negotiated several settlements, including the settlement relating to the Camp Bird Mine. The Chapter 7 trustee sought approval from the Bankruptcy Court to enter into these settlements, including the settlement for the cleanup of the Camp Bird property, and the sale of the property to Caldera. EPA and the Trustee signed the ASAOC before the August 1 bankruptcy hearing to illustrate to the court both parties’ commitment to clean up the property. On August 8, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement and transfer of the Camp Bird property to Caldera. On September 1, 2017, the bankruptcy trustee transferred the mine property to Caldera, free and clear of liens pursuant Bankruptcy Code section 363. Also on September 1, 2017, Caldera ratified the Trustee’s obligations under the settlement and began performing necessary cleanup work. Caldera also placed $1.2 million in a trust for the site.

122,NCR Corporation Agrees to End Litigation and Complete PCBs Cleanup at Fox River Superfund Site," On August 23, 2017, a consent decree between the United States, state of Wisconsin, and settling defendants NCR Corporation (NCR) and Appvion, Inc. was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Under the consent decree, NCR will perform and fund the remaining contaminated sediment cleanup work at the Fox River Superfund site  in Green Bay, Wisconsin at an estimated cost of over $200 million. The cleanup work will reduce the risks to humans and wildlife posed by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in bottom sediment of the Fox River. PCBs do not degrade naturally, but instead concentrate in the environment and the food chain resulting in health hazards to people, fish, and wildlife. The Lower Fox River project involves the cleanup of sediment contaminated with PCBs, as well as the restoration of the natural resources damaged by these contaminants.

Located in northeastern Wisconsin, it begins at the Menasha and Neenah channels leading from Lake Winnebago and flows northeast for 39 miles where it discharges into Green Bay and Lake Michigan. Approximately 270,000 people live in the communities along the river. The river has 12 dams and includes the highest concentration of pulp and paper mills in the world. During the 1950s and 1960s, the paper mills routinely used PCBs in their operations, which ultimately contaminated the river. The manufacture of NCR paper, along with the recycling of NCR paper by various paper mills, resulted in the release of PCBs into the Fox River via numerous wastewater discharge points. During that period, several paper companies discharged approximately 700,000 pounds of PCBs into the Fox River. Prior to commencement of cleanup at the site it was estimated that there were 14 million yards of contaminated sediments, which contained 65,000 pounds of PCBs, and an estimated 620 pounds of PCBs were flushed from the river into Green Bay annually. PCBs are a hazardous substance and probable human carcinogen. Risks and pathways addressed by the cleanup include health risks from people ingesting or touching contaminants in the river sediments. Because fish and wildlife are contaminated with PCBs, people who eat contaminated fish or waterfowl may suffer adverse health effects. Fish consumption advisories for the site remain in effect. More information is available from the Fox Rivers Superfund site profile page.

The settlement with NCR also resolves the government’s potential claims against Appvion, Inc., which purchased NCR’s paper manufacturing facilities in the Fox River Valley in the late 1970s. Appvion will not be involved in the remaining cleanup work at the Site. NCR also stipulated that it is jointly/severally liable for performance of long-term monitoring and cap maintenance. In its enforcement discretion, EPA and the state of Wisconsin will initially seek performance for this work from other parties at the site, including Georgia Pacific Corporation and P.H. Glatfelter. With regard to past and future costs, NCR stipulated that it is jointly/severally liable for the United States and state future costs, and in its enforcement discretion, EPA and the state will initially seek collection of those future costs from other parties. NCR will not be obligated to pay any of the United State’s past costs. The settlement also includes a waiver of claims by NCR against all other parties at the site. The waiver of claims includes any potential CERCLA § 106(b) claim NCR may have for reimbursement against the United States for costs NCR spent pursuant to a 2007 unilateral administrative order. All parties to the agreement agreed not to appeal prior orders, including divisibility rulings which were favorable to the U.S. This settlement ends the governments’ litigation at the site with NCR. Information about NCR Corporation and Appvion The NCR Corporation (originally National Cash Register) is an American computer hardware, software, and electronics company. The company began as the National Manufacturing Company of Dayton, Ohio, and was established to manufacture and sell the first mechanical cash register. In 1953, chemists at NCR submitted a patent for ""pressure responsive record materials"" for a carbon-less copy paper, which was commercialized as “NCR Paper.” From 1954 to 1971, PCBs were used in the emulsion to manufacture NCR copy paper.

123,Removal Settlement Addresses Discharge of High pH Water into the North Fork Holston River," On August 10, 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Removal Action (Removal Consent Order) with Olin Corporation for a time-critical removal action at a portion of the Saltville Waste Disposal Ponds Superfund site in Saltville, Virginia. Water with a pH of 11.5 or greater is discharging from a former chemical facility into the North Fork Holston River. The settlement agreement implements a removal action that is intended to abate an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment from high pH water discharging into the river. High pH water can potentially cause eye damage to humans and is pooling in seeps in areas that are readily accessible to the public. High pH water also has a negative impact on aquatic biota. The removal action includes the placement of riprap intended to create a physical barrier to prevent contact with the seeps of high pH water along the right descending bank of the river at the Saltville Waste Disposal Ponds Superfund site, direct the seeped material into mixing areas to lower the pH toward neutral, and allow for mixing of the seeped material with river water prior to potential human exposure. This will prevent exposure to human beings who might swim or engage in recreational activity in the river and will also improve river ecosystem health.

Health and Environmental Benefits As part of a supplemental environmental project (SEP), Harcros has agreed to install a foam fire suppression system at eight of its facilities for an overall expected expenditure of $2.49 million. The enhanced fire suppression system is expected to minimize the impacts of an accident, specifically a fire, by enhancing the speed and effectiveness of the facilities’ ability to extinguish the flames and prevent spread of chemicals. Overview of Company Harcros is an employee-owned corporation with its headquarters in Kansas City, Kansas. Harcros is a manufacturer and distributor of industrial and specialty chemicals with over 550 employees and annual sales of approximately $670 million. Harcros operates 31 facilities located in 19 states covering six EPA Regions, which are all parties to the settlement. Violations Harcros and EPA collaboratively developed a settlement structure for a voluntary, global settlement of potential RMP and GDC requirements at their facilities nationwide. The parties mutually negotiated an injunctive relief package which utilizes independent third party audits to identify and correct non-compliance at all Harcros facilities. Three “pilot” audits were conducted to serve as the starting point for negotiations and development of an injunctive relief package. Independent, third party auditors conducted audits at a representative sample of Harcros facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana, Bessemer, Alabama, and Kansas City, Kansas. The audits were conducted in Summer 2016 and revealed deficiencies with the General Duty Clause and Risk Management Program requirements. Specifically, deficiencies included non-compliance with General Duty Clause requirements to identify hazards using appropriate hazard assessment techniques, to design and maintain a safe facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases, and to minimize the consequences of accidental releases which do occur. The facilities subject to Risk Management Program requirements were shown to have not timely and adequately implemented all elements of a Risk Management Program that complies with 40 C.F.R. Part 68. Based on the findings of these audits, the parties developed and negotiated a program and schedule for conducting audits and completing corrections for the remainder of the company’s facilities. Pollutant Impacts Several facilities will be implementing process changes to reduce quantities of chemicals on-site to below RMP thresholds. Correction of chemical accident prevention provisions and general duty violations that may be identified by the audits will result in enhanced chemical accident prevention practices and safer handling of chemicals, and will ultimately lower the risk of release or accident that could result in harm to surrounding communities or the environment.","$950,000"

While in operation, these facilities required the storage, handling, and use of a variety of chemicals, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The MEW Study Area is comprised of three National Priorities List (NPL) sites: Fairchild Semiconductor Corp – Mountain View Superfund site, Raytheon Company Superfund site, and Intel Corp – Mountain View Superfund site; as well as portions of the former Naval Air Station Moffett Field Superfund site. During operation of these facilities, chemicals were released impacting soil and groundwater. In 1989, EPA signed a record of decision (ROD) to address soil and groundwater contamination both at source facilities and throughout the regional groundwater plume. In 2010, EPA amended the 1989 ROD selecting mitigation measures to address vapor intrusion into buildings overlying shallow subsurface contamination. The 1989 ROD and 2010 ROD Amendment are being implemented by the MEW potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under EPA oversight pursuant to a 1991 consent decree and 1990 unilateral administrative order and amendments. In 2012, site contamination was found to have impacted areas outside of the contiguous groundwater plume already being addressed under the 1989 ROD and 2010 ROD Amendment. This contamination appears to have been disposed of into the sewer system, where it accumulated and leaked out along the sewer lines. The property owned by Warmington Fairchild is impacted by this part of the Study Area. More information is available on the MEW Study Area Web page. Contact Information For more information, contact Bethany Dreyfus Assistant Regional Counsel U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 9 ORC-3 75 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94105 (415) 972-3886 dreyfus.bethany@epa.gov Summary of the BFPP Agreement EPA encourages the cleanup and reuse of contaminated properties by BFPPs and other third parties. When a BFPP is willing to perform cleanup work at a site of federal interest which exceeds their obligations to maintain their BFPP status, EPA and DOJ may enter into an agreement with the BFPP to address any liability concerns that may arise from the BFPP’s performance of the cleanup work. When recent sampling indicated that contamination on the property purchased by Warmington Fairchild was high enough that the vapor intrusion remedy may not be able to reliably prevent contaminant exposure in indoor air in overlying residences, EPA, DOJ and Warmington Fairchild entered into a BFPP agreement for cleanup work at the property. Under the BFPP agreement, Warmington Fairchild agreed to conduct cleanup activities to more quickly lower trichloroethene (TCE) soil gas contaminant concentrations to reduce potential human health risks from exposure through the vapor intrusion pathway. These activities will include soil vapor extraction and in-situ enhanced reductive dechlorination groundwater treatment of TCE in targeted “hot spot” areas. Lowering these shallow contaminant levels should reduce TCE source strength sufficiently that vapor intrusion mitigation measures on the property will reliably prevent vapor intrusion into overlying buildings at concentrations posing potential short-term or long-term health concerns. Information About Warmington Fairchild Associates, LLC Warmington Fairchild Associates, LLC, a California company, is located in Costa Mesa, California. In 2015, Warmington Fairchild purchased property as a BFPP within the MEW Study Area to redevelop it for residential homes. Warmington Fairchild represents it qualifies for the bona fide prospective purchaser (BFPP) protection from Superfund liability at the property. To receive the liability protection under Superfund, a BFPP must perform ""all appropriate inquiries"" prior to acquiring the property and meet other BFPP requirements such as providing certain notices, taking “reasonable steps” with regard to site contamination, providing cooperation, assistance, and access for response actions, and complying with institutional controls.",0

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide have adverse effects on human health and the environment. Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause or contribute to a variety of health problems and adverse environmental impacts, such as ground-level ozone, acid rain, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Affected populations include children and people with lung diseases such as asthma. Exposure to these conditions can cause damage to lung tissue for people who work or exercise outside. Sulfur Dioxide – High concentrations of sulfur dioxide can affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children, and the elderly. SO2 is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain. NOx Controls The Rocky Mountain Bottle Company will convert two of its three furnaces to one oxy-fuel furnace. The third furnace at the facility already uses oxy-fuel combustion. Oxy-fuel combustion will significantly reduce NOx emissions. The use of oxy-fuel combustion is designed to reduce the Rocky Mountain Bottle Company’s NOx emissions by approximately 60 percent from previous levels, to 1.1 pounds of NOx per ton of glass produced on a 30-day rolling average basis. Overview of Company Rocky Mountain Bottle Company, LLC is located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, a western suburb of Denver, Colorado, and manufactures glass containers for the food and beverage industry. Violations The United States alleges in the complaint that Rocky Mountain Bottle Company conducted a furnace expansion project without first obtaining pre-construction permits and installing required pollution control equipment. This resulted in significant emissions increases of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The United States also alleges in the complaint that Rocky Mountain Bottle Company violated Title V of the Clean Air Act (CAA) by failing to submit an application that included all applicable requirements in Rocky Mountain Bottle Company’s Title V permit. Pollutant Impacts EPA estimates that this settlement will result in the following emission reductions once all emission controls have been installed and implemented: NOx - 200 tons per year SO2 - 150 tons per year","475,000"

Under this compliance program, NVR will: Designate trained stormwater compliance representatives at the site, division and corporate levels who will be responsible for stormwater compliance at each site. Conduct pre-construction inspections at all new sites to ensure NPDES permits are obtained, stormwater pollution prevention plans are developed, and adequate stormwater controls are in place. Conduct management oversight inspections at every site each quarter. Implement a stormwater compliance training program for all stormwater compliance managers and other employees involved in construction activities. Submit national compliance reports to EPA annually. Comment Period The settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.

For more information, contact: Susan Bruce Water Enforcement Division 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW (Mail Code 2243A) Washington, DC 20460 (202) 564-8329bruce.susan@epa.gov Civil Penalty NVR will pay a civil penalty of $425,000. Health and Environmental Benefits Stormwater runoff from construction activities can significantly impact water quality. As stormwater flows over a construction site, it can pick up pollutants such as sediment, debris and chemicals and transport them to streams, rivers, lakes or coastal waters. Stormwater discharges containing sediment and turbidity can cause an array of physical, chemical and biological impacts on receiving waters. In addition to sediment and turbidity, other pollutants associated with construction sites (e.g., metals, organic compounds and nutrients) may become absorbed by or adsorbed onto mineral or organic particles found in fine sediment and subsequently discharged via stormwater runoff to nearby waters. The sediment, turbidity and other pollutants entrained in stormwater discharges contribute to aquatic ecosystem degradation, increased drinking water treatment costs, and impairment of the recreational uses and aesthetic values of waters. Sediment can also accumulate in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, leading to the need for dredging or other mitigation to prevent reduced water storage or navigation capacity. Overview of Company NVR, Inc. constructs, markets and sells a variety of residential properties and NVR currently constructs homes in fourteen states including New York and New Jersey. NVR’s typical business practice is to purchase lots for home construction within large subdivisions that were developed and originally owned by other companies. Violations NVR violated the stormwater requirements of the Clean Water Act by failing to obtain coverage under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit prior to commencing construction activities at 65 sites in New York and New Jersey. In addition, once NVR obtained the required permit coverage, it failed to comply with permit requirements at several sites inspected by EPA. EPA inspectors identified inadequately implemented or maintained sediment and erosion controls such as silt fencing, protection at construction entrances and storm drain inlet protection. Pollutant Impacts Construction stormwater NPDES permits require construction site operators to develop stormwater pollution prevention plans and implement practices that minimize erosion and the discharge of sediment and other pollutants in stormwater. NVR’s implementation of the company-wide compliance program required by the proposed consent decree will reduce the discharge of sediment and other pollutants from its construction sites into waterways.","$425,000"

EPA has identified 523 abandoned uranium mines on the Navajo Nation (NN), encompassing more than 27,000 square miles within Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. The unique geology of the region makes the Navajo Nation rich in uranium, a radioactive ore in high demand after the development of atomic power and weapons at the close of World War II. The federal government, through the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), was the sole purchaser of uranium until 1966, when commercial sales of uranium began. The AEC continued to purchase ore until 1970. The last uranium mine on the Navajo Nation shut down in 1986. Many Navajo people worked in and near the mines, often living and raising families in close proximity to the mines and mills where ore was processed. Since 2008, federal agencies—including EPA, the Department of Energy, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of the Interior, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Indian Health Service—have collaborated to address uranium contamination on the Navajo Nation.

Health and Environmental Benefits Human health effects of ozone include irritation of the respiratory system, reduction of lung function, aggravation of asthma, and inflammation/damage to the lining of the lung, especially for sensitive groups like children and people with respiratory disease, and adults who are active outdoors. Exposure to HAPs results in tangible inhalation, dermal or oral hazards, based on scientific exposure studies. HAPs are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects. Overview of Company Vopak North America Inc. (doing business as Vopak Americas) is a subsidiary of Royal Vopak, an international tank storage company headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, with 74 terminals in 26 countries. Today, Vopak Americas owns three terminals in the United States, the largest of which is the subject of this matter and is co-located with a waste treatment, recovery and disposal operation on the Houston Ship Channel in or around Deer Park, Texas. The terminal provides temporary storage for a range of products, including biofuels, chemicals, petroleum products, base oils, and lubricants, consisting of 243 tanks with a collective capacity of over 7 million barrels. The tanks range from 1,000 barrels to 80,000 barrels in size and receive products from barge, pipeline, rail, truck and marine vessels. Violations The air emissions at the terminal facility derive from three primary sources: terminal bulk storage tanks, flares, and the waste treatment, recovery and disposal operation, which includes a wastewater treatment system (WWTS). The terminal generates storm water and process wastewater that contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which Vopak treats on site at the WWTS. The EPA inspections of the facility in 2012, 2014, and 2015 identified, among other things, leaking tanks, inefficient flares, and process equipment (e.g., open-top tanks and VOC/water separators) at the WWTS that were releasing excess emissions of VOCs. A complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA and the State of Texas, alleges violations associated with all three of these sources and Vopak has agreed to implement a range of injunctive relief across the facility to address each of these issues. Pollutant Impacts The violations resulted in excess emissions of VOCs and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). VOCs are ozone precursors, with the excess VOC emissions contributing to the area’s ozone nonattainment status.",5000000 + 2500000 = 7500000

Health and Environmental Benefits Nitrogen Oxides - Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Sulfur Dioxide - High concentrations of SO2 affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children and the elderly. Sulfur dioxide is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain. Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs, along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Benzene - Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidences of leukemia have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene. EPA has classified benzene as a Group A human carcinogen.

Health and Environment Effects Oil spills are known to cause both immediate and long-term harm to human health and ecosystems. Oil limits oxygen in water and can suffocate wildlife. Oil emulsions may stick to the gills of fish or coat and destroy algae or other plankton. Floating oil may reduce water exposure to the circulation of oxygen and, in conjunction with emulsified oil, interfere with photosynthesis. Oil slicks can kill birds, contaminate food sources, reduce animal and plant reproduction and contaminate nesting habitats. Oil spills can cause long-term effects years later even if the oil remains in the environment for a relatively short period of time. Petroleum oils can also undergo oxidation and polymerization reactions and can form tars that persist in the environment for years. Overview of Company Sunoco Pipeline L.P. was founded in 2002 and operates as a subsidiary of Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., to transport crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and refined products through more than 8,000 miles of liquid pipelines. Sunoco Logistics’ crude oil business unit provides transportation, terminalling, and storage of crude oil throughout the southwest and midwest United States through approximately 5,900 miles of crude oil trunk and gathering pipelines and they also have equity ownership interests in three crude oil pipelines. The company also conducts crude oil acquisition and marketing activities, primarily in the mid-continental United States. Violations Sunoco discharged approximately 1,950 barrels of gasoline from a pipeline near Wellington, Ohio in January 2012, in violation of Section 311(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). Pollutant Impacts Due to the fact that the changes Sunoco implemented as a result of this discharge are preventative in nature, it is not possible to estimate a specific total pollutant reduction associated with this Consent Decree.","990,000"

Health and Environment Effects When the required injunctive relief is implemented, the consent decree will help reduce the exposure of surrounding communities to pollutants that can significantly impair streams and watersheds. The injunctive relief is projected to result in the following annual reductions: 17,520 pounds of total suspended solids; 29,930 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand Overview of Company EMD Millipore, known as Merck Millipore outside of the United States and Canada, is the American subsidiary of Merck, and was formed when Merck acquired the Millipore Corporation in 2010. EMD Millipore is the life science business of Merck, and Merck is a German multinational pharmaceutical and chemical company with around 40,000 employees in 64 countries. EMD Millipore operates a facility located in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, which employs around 600 people and manufactures plastic membrane water filtration devices for the pharmaceutical and biomedical industry worldwide. Violations The noncompliance addressed by the consent decree includes Millipore’s violation of the Clean Water Act pretreatment regulations by causing pass through and interference at the Jaffrey, New Hampshire publicly owned treatment works (POTW). Millipore introduced wastewaters into the Jaffrey POTW in violation of the federal pH prohibition standard and failed to notify the POTW of potential problems, including slug loadings associated with wastewaters introduced into the POTW. Millipore also violated its industrial wastewater discharge permit and Jaffrey’s sewer use ordinance by discharging to the POTW industrial process wastewater in excess of the permitted industrial flow rate limits. Millipore’s pass through and interference violations occurred on numerous occasions from February 2011 through March of 2015. Those violations resulted from Millipore’s periodically introducing high strength organic waste that inhibited the POTW’s biological treatment systems and led to excessive amounts of ammonia nitrogen and/or carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (“cBOD”) in the POTW’s discharge to the Contoocook River. Millipore also violated the pretreatment regulations by introducing wastewaters to the POTW with a pH outside the federal limit on numerous occasions from August 2011 through February 2015. The facility also violated the pretreatment regulations by failing to notify the POTW of discharges that had a potential to disrupt the operations at the POTW. Failing to notify the POTW of such discharges contributes to the POTW violating its permit limits. Pollutant Impacts The pollutants in this case include ammonia, total suspended solids, hydrogen ion concentration, and oxygen demanding pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand. Millipore’s periodic introduction of high strength organic waste into the POTW inhibited its biological treatment systems, and led to excessive amounts of ammonia nitrogen and/or cBOD in the POTW’s discharge to the Contoocook River. The discharge of pollutants to the POTW with a pH less than 5.0 could also corrode piping and equipment in the POTW treatment plant itself and create a dangerous working environment for sewage treatment plant workers.","$385,000"

Health and Environment Effects Total Suspended Solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) – Indicates the amount of organic compounds in water. High COD levels can present threats to human health including toxic algae blooms bacteria from organic wastes and seafood contamination HSD’s State Supplemental Environmental Projects HSD will spend an estimated $555,000 on a supplemental environmental project involving the construction of a bike trail through an Indiana wildlife preserve in the City of Hammond, with bioswale drainage that is intended to reduce storm water runoff.

Although a majority of Whole Foods Market stores may qualify as CESQGs in any given month, the enhanced hazardous waste program implemented by Whole Foods Market generally seeks to satisfy the hazardous waste generator requirements applicable to Small Quantity Generators and, therefore, goes above and beyond the minimum requirements applicable under the law. Whole Foods Market’s compliance provisions under the consent agreement include: Continue to implement an advanced system to properly accumulate and store hazardous waste on-site, including inspections and management of containers. Whole Foods Market began implementing this system in advance of finalizing the settlement agreement with EPA. Continue to implement comprehensive hazardous waste management training at its stores for employees. Whole Foods Market began implementing this training in advance of finalizing the settlement agreement with EPA. Put in place a wide-range of operational changes to ensure compliance with RCRA, including employing advanced technology for hazardous waste identification.

Health and Environmental Benefits Although Whole Foods Market’s RCRA violations presented potential harm to public health and the environment through exposure to hazardous wastes, there is no evidence of any actual harm from the violations alleged in the consent agreement. Supplemental Environmental Project Under the settlement agreement, Whole Foods Market will spend $2.75 million to perform a supplemental environmental project to protect children’s health by replacing older fluorescent lighting fixtures that contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in public schools and community centers serving children located in low to moderate income areas. Whole Foods Market will also provide hazardous waste training to school and community center personnel, specifically teaching them about the proper identification, handling and disposal of hazardous wastes located and used in the schools and community centers where the supplemental environmental project is performed. Settlement Overview Whole Foods Market owns and operates hundreds of retail grocery stores throughout the United States. These grocery stores are organized and managed by region. Following settlements with EPA Region 6 covering stores in several southern/southwestern states, Whole Foods Market voluntarily approached EPA to discuss the possibility of entering into a broad-based nationwide settlement agreement for their stores located in all U.S. States and Territories (other than those covered by the Region 6 settlements). Violations For purposes of the national settlement, Whole Foods Market voluntarily disclosed to EPA that it may not have consistently made sufficient hazardous waste determinations on all solid waste streams (e.g., discarded consumer products) or complied with some of the “universal waste” standards at all of its stores as required by 40 C.F.R. §§ 262.11 and 273.13 through 273.16. Common consumer products that have to be handled as hazardous waste if they cannot be restocked or resold include: certain cleaning products, detergents, paints and polishes, batteries, pesticides and fluorescent light bulbs. These items are required to be managed as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Most, if not all, Whole Foods Market Stores generate 100 kilograms of hazardous waste or less in any given month, and therefore, are considered Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQGs) pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 261.5. Pollutant Impacts The injunctive relief is designed to prevent hazardous waste from being improperly handled and disposed of, and to minimize the risk of exposure of waste to workers and others. In addition, the supplemental environmental project will eliminate the exposure to PCBs in schools and community centers serving children, as well as public school/community center employees in communities with environmental justice concerns.",500000

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The injunctive relief required by the settlement to improve the safety of Magellan’s practices and to enhance its oil spill preparedness and response are designed both to prevent the likelihood of a future oil spill, and to minimize the adverse effects of a spill if it should happen. Oil spills are known to cause both immediate and long-term harm to human health and ecosystems. Oil limits oxygen in water and can suffocate wildlife. Oil emulsions may stick to the gills of fish or coat and destroy algae or other plankton. Floating oil may reduce water exposure to the circulation of oxygen and, in conjunction with emulsified oil, interfere with photosynthesis. Oil slicks can kill birds, contaminate food sources, reduce animal and plant reproduction and contaminate nesting habitats. Oil spills can cause long-term effects years later even if the oil remains in the environment for a relatively short period of time. Petroleum oils can also undergo oxidation and polymerization reactions and can form tars that persist in the environment for years. Overview Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P., is a Delaware limited partnership that is headquartered in Tulsa, Okla. The company owns and operates an approximately 11,000-mile pipeline system that transports liquid petroleum products across 15 states in the central United States.

Violations According to a complaint and consent decree filed today in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, Tulsa, Okla.-based Magellan is responsible for spilling a combined total of approximately 5,177 barrels of petroleum products in three separate incidents. The complaint alleges that Magellan was responsible for the following illegal discharges: On Feb. 24, 2011, a Magellan owned 18-inch refined petroleum products pipeline ruptured in an area north of Texas City, Texas, and spilled approximately 482 barrels of gasoline. The spill impacted a local watercourse known as Pierre Bayou. On Dec. 10, 2011, two of Magellan’s refined petroleum products pipelines were struck by a third-party who was operating heavy machinery while attempting to clear a hedgerow in an agricultural field near the town of Nemaha, Neb. The strikes resulted in the spilling of approximately 650 barrels of diesel fuel from one line, and approximately 655 barrels of jet fuel and 1,529 barrels of gasoline from the other. The spills impacted a local watercourse know as Jarvis Creek. Cleanup efforts are still underway and will be completed as part of the proposed consent decree.

IDNR conducted sampling at four downstream locations and found high levels of E. coli – a pathogen found in manure and process wastewater. Overview of Company Meadowvale Dairy, LLC, operates two National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) – permitted large concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) confining a total of approximately 9,000 head of cattle on a combined 185 acres in Rock Valley, IA. The operation includes four locations – the North Site and the South Site (both of which are permitted), a calf barn/hut, and a satellite concrete manure storage structure. Violations Mismanagement of animal wastes at all four locations is responsible for Meadowvale’s unpermitted discharges of pollutants in violation of Section 301 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) alleged in this action. Meadowvale also had numerous NPDES permit violations related to failure to adequately operate and maintain its manure storage structures. The state of Iowa identified multiple violations of the facilities’ permits dating back to at least 2002, including two fish kills in 2004 and 2009. These violations resulted in at least three penalty assessments initiated by the state. State and EPA inspections discovered unauthorized discharges of stormwater runoff in 2013 and 2014.","160,000"

The penalty is payable over a three-year period in equal installments with prejudgment interest beginning 90 days after entry of the order by the court. Health and Environmental Benefits Emission standards for diesel engines and equipment reduce emissions of, among other pollutants, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The key health effects categories associated with ambient particulate matter include premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma and acute respiratory symptoms including aggravated coughing and difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and increased allergenicity have also been observed. Diesel exhaust particulate matter is of special concern. The EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has concluded that diesel exhaust is likely to be carcinogenic to humans. In addition to these health effects, particulate matter generally causes damage to, and soiling of, commonly used building materials and culturally important items such as statues and works of art. It is also a major cause of substantial visibility impairment in many parts of the United States. NOx pollution contributes to the formation of harmful smog and soot, exposure to which is linked to a number of respiratory- and cardiovascular-related health effects as well as premature death. Children, older adults, people who are active outdoors (including outdoor workers), and people with heart or lung disease are particularly at risk for health effects related to smog or soot exposure. Nitrogen dioxide formed by NOx emissions can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, and may also contribute to asthma development in children. Overview of Company Bandit Industries, Inc., based in Remus, Michigan, is a manufacturer of self-powered, industrial-strength wood and waste processing equipment, such as whole tree wood chippers. Violations Based on information disclosed by Bandit and obtained through an EPA investigation, EPA alleged that Bandit committed 2,552 violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA) due to non-compliance with the requirements of the Act’s Transition Program for Equipment Manufacturers (TPEM). Bandit allegedly sold certain non-road compression-ignition, diesel-fueled engines and equipment that were neither covered by the certificates of conformity required under Section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, nor exempt from that certification requirement because Bandit’s engines and equipment failed to meet the TPEM regulations. Additionally, at the outset of its participation in TPEM, Bandit allegedly “stockpiled” prior model year engines in exceedance of normal inventory. The CAA prohibits stockpiling engines that meet older emission standards before a new emission standard takes effect. To meet current diesel-fuel Tier 4 emission standards, equipment manufacturers generally modify their equipment designs to accommodate engines with additional and improved emissions control devices. In the TPEM program, EPA adopted transition provisions for equipment manufacturers to provide flexibility for equipment manufacturers to selectively delay compliance with current emissions standards for up to seven years. Bandit allegedly did not transition to the current emissions standards in time and sold equipment with older noncompliant engines, creating a competitive advantage over equipment manufacturers offering compliant products.",3000000
146,Tauber Oil Company Clean Air Act Settlement," (Washington, DC - January 18, 2017) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced a settlement with Tauber Oil Company, resolving alleged Clean Air Act violations stemming from the company's sale of a fuel additive that was not registered with the EPA.

Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice. Environmental Benefits and Pollutant Reductions Sections 211(a) and 211(f) of the Clean Air Act, and the associated implementing regulations, set up precautionary programs for fuels and fuel additives. The precautionary approach ensures that emissions standards for motor vehicles are not undermined (for example, through additional emissions from fuel or fuel additive combustion not anticipated in the engine certification or through the fuel or fuel additive causing harm to vehicle emission control devices). Tauber’s sales of the Mixed Alcohol product for use as a fuel additive undermined the protections of section 211’s precautionary requirements. Tauber represents that all domestic sales of Mixed Alcohol for use as a fuel additive have ceased as of April 2012. For more information, contact: Virginia Sorrell, Attorney Air Enforcement Division Office of Civil Enforcement U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1595 Wynkoop Street (8MSU) Denver, CO 80202 (303) 312-6669 sorrell.virginia@epa.gov Civil Penalty Tauber will pay a $700,000 civil penalty to the United States. Overview of Company Tauber Oil Company is a Houston-based, privately-held company that markets petroleum and petrochemical products. Tauber combined various low-cost alcohol streams to produce a product it called “Mixed Alcohol” in a leased shore tank at a NuStar Energy L.P. facility in Texas City, Texas. The largest component of the Mixed Alcohol was a byproduct of isopropyl alcohol manufacturing. Tauber sold approximately 1.9 million gallons of Mixed Alcohol to Gulftech Marketing, LP, which blended the Mixed Alcohol into fuel prior to distribution to service stations for purchase by consumers. Tauber represents that, as of April 2012, it ceased domestic sales of Mixed Alcohol for use as a fuel additive. Violations The Clean Air Act sets up a precautionary program for registration of fuels and fuel additives to ensure that changes to composition of fuels and fuel additives do not undermine the emissions performance of motor vehicles, either through increased emissions from combustion of the fuel or fuel additive or through harm caused to vehicle emissions control devices by the fuel or fuel additive. As one component of the precautionary program, the Clean Air Act requires fuel additive manufacturers to register a fuel additive prior to selling, offering for sale, or otherwise introducing a fuel additive into commerce. Registration identifies the chemical composition of the additive and ensures adequate information and testing to determine potential public health and environmental effects that might result from its use. The regulations define “additive manufacturer” as “any person who produces, manufactures, or imports an additive for use as an additive and/or sells or imports for sale such additive under the person’s own name.” Tauber met the definition of additive manufacturer because it produced Mixed Alcohol by blending various low-cost alcohol streams in a shore tank and then sold the Mixed Alcohol for use as a fuel additive. Further, Tauber sold Mixed Alcohol under its own name for use as a fuel additive (i.e., Tauber did not simply resell another company's additive). Therefore, Tauber allegedly violated the Clean Air Act by failing to register Mixed Alcohol as a fuel additive. As a second component of the precautionary program, the Clean Air Act requires fuel and fuel additives to be substantially similar to what was used in certification of motor vehicles. The “substantially similar” requirement is intended to ensure that changes to fuels and fuel additives do not cause or contribute to a failure of emission control devices to achieve compliance (over the useful life of the vehicles) with the emission standards to which the vehicle has been certified. The EPA has promulgated an interpretive rule defining the term “substantially similar.” The interpretive rule sets forth criteria that must be met for a fuel additive to be “substantially similar” to a fuel or fuel additive used in the certification of a motor vehicle or engine. One criteria is that the fuel containing the fuel additive may only contain up to 0.3 percent methanol by volume, unless it also contains an equal volume of butanol, or higher molecular weight alcohol, in which case it can contain up to 2.75 percent methanol by volume. Fuel containing Mixed Alcohol had greater than 2.75 percent methanol by volume. Further, fuel containing Mixed Alcohol did not contain a volume of butanol (or higher molecular weight alcohol) at least equal to the volume of methanol. Therefore, Tauber allegedly violated the Clean Air Act by failing to ensure that Mixed Alcohol, and fuel containing Mixed Alcohol, met the requirements for being “substantially similar.”",700000

Tyler will conduct a comprehensive assessment of its sanitary sewer system, including sewers, lift stations and force mains to identify defects and deficiencies that may lead to SSOs. The city will fix or replace all sewer pipe segments and manholes that have been identified as likely to fail or cause SSOs. All remedial measures must be completed within the next 10 years. In addition, Tyler will evaluate and develop projects to address sewer capacity deficiencies. Tyler will also develop and implement a capacity, management, operation, and maintenance program which includes comprehensive system cleaning and a grease and root control program, to minimize SSOs caused by operation and maintenance deficiencies. EPA estimates that the total cost of implementing these measures could exceed $65 million plus the cost of routine operation and maintenance. Comment Period Once the proposed consent decree is lodged with the court, the settlement will be subject to a 30-day public comment period. Pollutant Reductions Through the implementation of the proposed Consent Decree, the following estimated annual pollutant reductions will result: 510 pounds of total suspended solids; 488 pounds of biochemical oxygen demand; 79 pounds of total nitrogen; and 11 pounds of total phosphorus. Environmental Justice Many of the manholes and lift stations from which SSOs occur repeatedly are located in areas with low income and minority populations. This settlement requires Tyler to consider low income and minority communities when prioritizing assessment activities and rehabilitation efforts to eliminate SSOs in those neighborhoods. When the injunctive relief is implemented, the settlement will help reduce the direct exposure of these communities in Tyler to sewage discharges.

Civil Penalty Tyler will pay a civil penalty of $563,000 which will be split equally between the United States and the State of Texas. Health and Environmental Effects Total suspended solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients - Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. Overview of Sewer Authority and Facility Location The City of Tyler owns and operates a separate sanitary sewer system, which includes the Southside and Westside wastewater treatment plants and the wastewater collection and transmission system. Tyler’s system consists of 600 miles of sewer lines and 22 lift stations. Enhanced/Next Gen Compliance Tyler will take measures to increase transparency by creating a public document repository that will include the settlement document (Consent Decree), any report required by this Consent Decree and all final EPA approved construction and maintenance plans to its website. Violations Tyler violated Section 301 of the Clean Water Act and terms and conditions of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, which set limits for how much of a certain pollutant an entity is allowed to discharge into a waterbody. Tyler’s alleged violations include frequent discharges of raw sewage to waters of the United States and failure to prevent sanitary sewer overflows through proper operation and maintenance of its system.","$563,000"

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits The settlement’s environmental benefits include: Cessation of the disposal of approximately 8.7 million gallons (72,210,000 pounds) of RP Pondwater waste per year historically sent to an unpermitted facility. Innophos has modified its operations and now employs a filter system that generates a filter cake waste that is handled as regulated hazardous waste and disposed of in an authorized facility. Cessation of the disposal of approximately 30 million gallons (249 million pounds) of raffinate waste per year historically sent to an unpermitted facility. Innophos is pursuing authorization that would allow it to dispose of the waste in a permitted underground injection well system. Overview of Company Innophos manufactures purified phosphoric acid from merchant grade acid at its facility in Geismar, Louisiana. The phosphoric acid is supplied for use in food and technical applications and markets. Innophos’ corporate headquarters is in Cranbury, New Jersey. Pollutant Impacts RP Pondwater - This waste stream consists of a concentrated acid stream with a pH below two and is characteristically hazardous for arsenic, cadmium and chromium. Raffinate - This waste stream consists of a concentrated acid stream with a pH below two and is characteristically hazardous for cadmium and chromium. Innophos’ violations may have led to releases of hazardous waste to the environment, including the Mississippi River. The surrounding community, which includes areas that give rise to environmental justice concerns, relies on the Mississippi River for a variety of purposes. Violations During an EPA inspection of Innophos’ facility in Geismar, Louisiana in 2004, it was discovered that Innophos had sent toxic waste streams for disposal at a neighboring facility that was not permitted to receive them. The neighboring facility is a phosphoric acid manufacturer that produces the acid from phosphate ore. Innophos’ specific RCRA violations include failures to: Make accurate hazardous waste determinations Submit annual reports to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality Treat or store hazardous waste in tanks with a permit or interim status at the Innophos facility Perform land disposal determination and notification Ship hazardous waste to a permitted treatment, storage, and/or disposal facility",1398000

For impacted areas that cannot be restored, and for any temporal loses, the Defendants must perform mitigation to compensate for the loss of permanent and temporal aquatic resources. This could be accomplished through the purchase of mitigation credits, a mitigation project, other permissible compensatory mitigation, or payment of an in-lieu-fee. Additionally, the Defendants must ensure that the restored areas will be stabilized and that native species will be used for replanting. Finally, the Defendants must incorporate quantitative performance measures and monitor the restoration site for five years. The Defendants must ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to prevent future disturbance of the restored areas by recording a deed restriction in the deed recording office for the county in which the site is located. If, at the end of five years, the Defendants have met the required performance measures, no further monitoring is required. However, if the Defendants have not secured a deed restriction permanently preserving the impacted areas, monitoring must continue for a total of ten years.

The Defendants will pay the remaining $900,000 to the State of West Virginia within 365 days of the effective date of the consent decree. Health and Environmental Effects As a result of these alleged violations, the Defendants’ actions have dramatically reduced the biological, chemical, and physical functions that the impacted streams and wetlands had performed. Impounding, realigning, culverting, and cementing the streams, and filling the wetlands has destroyed valuable aquatic habitat and has reduced the streams’ and wetlands’ ability to cycle nutrients, export carbon, and reduce nitrogen. Headwaters, such as Laurel Run and its unnamed tributaries, and wetlands are also sources of fresh water, and changes to these waterbodies can negatively affect rivers and lakes downstream. Overview of Company The proposed consent decree in this matter resolves a Clean Water Act (CWA) civil judicial action against Greer Industries, Inc., Deckers Creek Limestone Co., and Pikewood, Inc. (collectively, Defendants) for alleged violations involving the unauthorized discharge of dredged and fill material to waters of the United States. The alleged violations occurred during the construction of the Pikewood National Golf Club in Monongalia County, West Virginia. The State of West Virginia is a co-plaintiff in this action. Violations The Defendants allegedly discharged dredged and fill material into waters of the United States without authorization, in violation of CWA Sections 301 and 404. Specifically, the unauthorized activities occurred in Laurel Run and its unnamed tributaries, and included: six in-line stream impoundments, realignment and culverting of stream segments, cementing of streams and spillways, and impacts to seeps. These activities began in 2000 and were completed in the summer of 2007. The Defendants also deposited dredged and fill material into wetlands, in approximately July 2010. The Defendants did not, at any time, apply for a CWA Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). In all, the Defendants filled approximately 6,402 linear feet of streams and approximately 0.12 acres of wetlands.","1,800,000"

Health and Environmental Effects Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through MS4s and ultimately discharged untreated into local rivers, lakes and streams. Common pollutants discharged through MS4s include road salt, sand, oil and grease from roadways; pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides from lawns and parks; sediment from construction sites; and carelessly discarded trash, such as cigarette butts, paper wrappers, and plastic bottles. Discharges from MS4s also often include contaminated stormwater runoff from industrial facilities as well as illicit discharges of wastes and wastewater from non-stormwater sources. Illicit discharges can enter the MS4 through direct connections (e.g., wastewater piping either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the MS4) or indirect connections (e.g., infiltration into the MS4, spills collected by storm drains, or paint or used oil dumped directly into a storm drain). In addition, municipalities conduct numerous activities that can pose a threat to water quality if practices and procedures are not in place to prevent pollutants from entering the MS4. These activities include winter road maintenance, minor road repairs and other infrastructure work, automobile fleet maintenance, landscaping and park maintenance, and building maintenance. The result is untreated discharges that contribute high levels of pollutants, including heavy metals, toxics, oil and grease, solvents, nutrients, viruses, and bacteria to receiving waters. When discharged into nearby waterways through MS4s, these pollutants can degrade water quality, thereby discouraging recreational uses, contaminating drinking water supplies, and adversely impacting fish, other aquatic life and wildlife. In addition, an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces (e.g., parking lots, driveways, and rooftops) resulting from new development can impact waterbodies by increasing the quantity and velocity of water delivered to the waterbodies during storms. This can result in streambank scouring and erosion and downstream flooding which can harm aquatic life and damage property. The stormwater NPDES permit program requires municipalities to develop and implement a stormwater management program that is intended to improve the quality of local waterways by reducing the impact of new development and reducing the amount of pollutants that stormwater runoff and melting snow pick up and carry into storm sewer systems. Overview On May 27, 2014 the court entered a consent decree to resolve the city’s violations of the Clean Water Act related to illegal discharges from sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). In April 2015, after the 2014 consent decree was entered, EPA conducted an audit of the city’s compliance with its Connecticut General Permit for the Discharge of Stormwater from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems issued to the city by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP), as authorized by the EPA under Section 402(b) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. §1342(b), The EPA audit revealed that the city failed to comply with conditions established in its small MS4 general permit. Violations The supplemental complaint alleges that the city failed to comply with conditions established in its small MS4 general permit. Specifically, the city failed to: Update its stormwater management plan and submit an annual report since 2009; Properly monitor its outfalls in 2011, 2012 and 2013; Put in place a public education program related to stormwater; Adequately map its MS4 system; Put in place a way to eliminate illicit discharges; and Review its stormwater management plan to determine whether stormwater from the city’s five outfalls that discharge into New Haven Harbor met permitted limits.",No claimable amount is provided in the case details.

152,Expedited Settlement Addresses Impacts on Drinking Water after On-site Explosion," On December 7, 2016, an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for a Removal Action (Removal ASAOC) between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Airosol, Co., Inc. was signed and completed. The expedited settlement allowed Airosol to quickly address onsite contamination, stop any migration of contaminants to adjacent waterways and move forward in getting their business back in operation. The business employs over 40 people in this small southeast Kansas community of 2,500 residents. A November 22, 2016, explosion and fire at the Airosol, Co., Inc. plant in Neodesha, Kansas demolished a good portion of the plant and caused significant contamination to adjacent waterways affecting several water supplies for multiple cities downstream. Quick action by the state of Kansas, EPA, and local authorities minimized the potential harm and allowed an expedited cleanup of the contamination. On this page: Information about Airosol, Inc.

Inc. Site On November 22, 2016, an explosion and large fire occurred at the Airosol, Co., Inc. Site. As a result of this fire and explosion the buildings at the Site were heavily damaged. Three people were injured, one seriously with burns and two others had breathing problems. The facility where the business is operated is located at 1206 Illinois Street, Neodesha, Wilson County, Kansas 66757. The facility consists of three buildings with a combined total area of approximately 111,665 square feet. Manufacturing (mixing and packaging) activities are conducted within these buildings. The explosion, fire, and subsequent use of water and foam suppressants to put the fire out caused chemicals at the site to be spread throughout the site and off-site areas. Twelve different contaminants of concern were known to be present at the site, including acetone, cyclohexane, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethyl acetate, ethylene glycol, heptane, hexane, methanol, PCE, toluene, vinyl acetate copolymer and xylene. Firefighting-related runoff from the site entered the Fall River, which drains into the Verdigris River. Runoff from the site entered the Fall and Verdigris Rivers, which are drinking water sources for Neodesha and downstream communities including Independence, Kansas and Coffeyville, Kansas, as well as Delaware, Lenapah, and Nowata communities in Oklahoma. Water sampling activities were conducted immediately after the fire and in the days following the event from the Fall and Verdigris Rivers. This sampling showed several contaminants above health-based levels of concern, including acetone, dietheylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol, methanol, PCE, and toluene. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) issued a do not drink order for Wilson County Rural Water District (RWD) No. 12. KDHE issued the order because raw untreated water was pumped into the distribution system for fire suppression at the site. Similar orders were issued for Wilson County RWDs No.4 and No. 8, the City of Neodesha, the City of Dearing, Labatte County RWD No. 6, and Montgomery County RWDs. No. 1-C, No. 2C-A and No. 2C-B. These orders were issued on November 22, 2016 and remained in effect until November 28, 2016. Immediately following the incident, the Kansas State Governor Sam Brownback issued a state of disaster emergency declaration for Montgomery and Wilson counties in Kansas.

By December 7, 2016, EPA and Airosol had completed and signed a Removal ASAOC. On the same day, EPA finalized an action memorandum laying out the work to be done by Airosol to address site contaminants. The ASAOC required Airosol to complete all actions necessary to implement the action memorandum. In general, Airosol had to ensure that any remaining hazardous substance releases were contained on site to the extent practicable and ensure that no runoff was allowed to enter the Fall River or its tributaries until completion of the cleanup activity. Airosol also had to stabilize the site to minimize hazards to on-site workers and the public, and remove and properly dispose of hazardous substances that remained on site or that may have migrated off site during fire suppression efforts. The quick completion of the ASAOC allowed the onsite work to be completed within several weeks after the fire and explosion. Information about Airosol, Inc. Airosol Company, Inc. was established in 1943 as Airosol, Inc., to manufacture aerosol containers of insecticide for the military during World War II.

	Contact",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/slawson-exploration-company-inc-clean-air-act-settlement,Consent Decree,2016-12-01,"Settlement Resources Consent Decree Injunctive Relief The settlement requires the following actions to resolve the Clean Air Act violations: Slawson will perform engineering evaluations addressing certain identified minimum considerations to ensure its vapor control systems are properly designed and sized to control VOC emissions. Following the engineering evaluations, Slawson must make any necessary modifications to ensure each vapor control system is properly designed and sized, perform infrared camera inspections to ensure that the vapor control systems are controlling emissions and the tanks are not emitting VOCs, and then implement a directed inspection and preventative maintenance program to ensure proper upkeep and operation of the systems. The directed inspection and preventative maintenance program will include semi-annual infrared camera inspections of all Slawson well pads to ensure ongoing proper operation and maintenance of vapor control systems, and to detect and prevent emissions from other components, such as valves and connectors, more broadly at Slawson well pads. A third-party auditor will review Slawson’s engineering evaluations for each vapor control system and perform infrared camera inspections at all storage tanks, associated combustion devices, and any open-ended lines at each well pad. Slawson will evaluate the condition of thief hatches, and mountings and gaskets, on each storage tank and address any evidence of VOC emissions from those components. Slawson will install Next Generation electronic pressure monitors with continuous data logging on a total of 60 tank batteries, 58 of which will be located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, to verify that storage tanks are not experiencing increased pressure readings indicative of tank over-pressurization that could cause emissions. Further, Slawson will install analog pressure gauges that allow for manual readings on half of its tank batteries. Slawson will replace all pit flares being used to control storage tank emissions in North Dakota with a control device capable of achieving a 98 percent control efficiency. It is estimated that implementation of these actions will cost approximately $4.1 million and reduce emissions by over 11,700 tons per year of VOCs, 400 tons per year of HAPs, and 2,600 tons per year of methane.

S. Environmental Protection Agency 1595 Wynkoop Street (8MSU) Denver, CO 80202 (303) 312-6669sorrell.virginia@epa.gov Mitigation Projects Slawson will perform the following environmental mitigation projects that will provide additional reductions in ozone precursor emissions – VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx): Installation and operation of $1.5 million in equipment to allow for auto-gauging of storage tanks so as to decrease the need to open thief hatches; and Drill rig emission controls through one of three options for every drill rig used by Slawson in North Dakota while the consent decree is in effect: using electrification to power the rig, using a selective catalytic reduction module as an add on control for the drill rig exhaust, or retrofitting the engines. Slawson estimates that the drill rig controls will cost approximately $550,000 per drill rig. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Civil Penalty Slawson will pay a $2.1 million civil penalty to the United States. Health and Environmental Effects Ozone is not emitted directly from air pollution sources. Instead, it is photochemical oxidant formed when certain chemicals – VOCs and NOx – in the ambient air react with oxygen in the presence of sunlight. VOCs and NOx are called “ozone precursors.” Sources that emit ozone precursors are regulated to reduce ground-level ozone in the ambient air. Ground-level ozone causes a wide variety of health and environmental impacts, including temporary breathing difficulty for people with asthma, respiratory illness, and aggravation of existing heart disease. VOC emissions from Slawson’s oil and natural gas operations in North Dakota include HAPs, primarily benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. HAPs, also known as air toxics, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. Benzene has been classified by the EPA as a known human carcinogen. Although North Dakota is currently classified as attainment/unclassifiable for all criteria pollutants, some scientific studies have concluded that VOC emissions from North Dakota oil and gas production operations may impact much of the United States and Canada, as well as have global impacts in terms of ethane and GHG emissions. The following are two examples of recent studies: Fugitive emissions from the Bakken shale illustrate role of shale production in global ethane shift, available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL068703/epdf. This study concludes that Bakken shale emissions now account for 1-3% of global ethane emissions. Aerial Surveys of Elevated Hydrocarbon Emissions from Oil and Gas Production Sites, available at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.6b00705. This study discusses the impact of GHG and VOC emissions from oil and gas production and notes that the Bakken had the highest well pad leak rate observed in any surveyed basin. Overview of Company and Facility Slawson is a privately held oil and gas exploration company that was founded by Donald C. Slawson in 1957. Slawson has drilled over 3,500 wells in ten states, including in 14 different formations in seven basins, and it has regional exploration offices in Denver, Oklahoma City, Houston, and Wichita. Slawson’s oil and natural gas operations in North Dakota are located both on and off the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Slawson’s oil and natural gas production operations in North Dakota use storage tanks to store produced oil and water at well pads prior to transport by pipeline or truck. Multiple storage tanks are typically present at a well pad and are frequently controlled by the same vapor control system. Vapor control systems are required for these storage tanks pursuant to the North Dakota State Implementation Plan or the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation Federal Implementation Plan, depending on whether the well pad is located on tribal lands. Improperly or inadequately designed, operated, or maintained vapor control systems can lead to uncontrolled emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), primarily benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. Today’s settlement resolves alleged violations at all of Slawson’s approximately 170 well pads in North Dakota that have wells in production. Pollutant Reductions The following emissions reductions are estimated to result from implementation of this settlement’s injunctive relief at Slawson’s well pads in North Dakota: VOCs: Greater than 11,700 tons per year; HAPs: Greater than 400 tons per year; and Methane: Greater than 2,600 tons per year. Violations The settlement resolves past violations of the North Dakota State Implementation Plan and the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation Federal Implementation Plan requirements for control of VOC and HAP emissions from oil and natural gas well pads. Specifically, this settlement resolves provisions implicated by claims that Slawson failed to adequately design, operate, and maintain vapor control systems on its storage tanks at oil and natural gas well pads, resulting in emissions of VOCs, HAPs, and methane.",$2.1 Million

155,BFPP Settlement Addresses Cleanup and Continued Operations at Property in Washington State," On November 11, 2016, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Star Forge, LLC (Star Forge) entered into a Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser Settlement Agreement (BFPP Settlement) to address cleanup work at the Jorgensen Forge Property located within the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Washington State. Without the BFPP Settlement, bankrupt Jorgensen Forge Corporation (Jorgensen) would have ceased operations and liquidated its assets. Instead, the BFPP Settlement allows Star Forge to continue operations and complete the cleanup, which will protect human health and the environment. Under the settlement Star Forge also set aside $500,000, which will be made available to potentially responsible parties (PRPs) who enter into a settlement with EPA to undertake cleanup actions elsewhere at the Lower Duwamish Site. This agreement preserves 111 metal working jobs and helps the local economy. Under the BFPP Settlement, Star Forge agreed to take over plant operations from Jorgensen and contribute to the $1.9 million in necessary environmental cleanup on the property. This cleanup will be performed with Boeing, who is a potentially responsible party at the Site. The $500,000 set aside will provide an important inducement for PRPs to enter into cleanup settlements at the Lower Duwamish Site. In return, the United States provided Star Forge with a covenant not to sue under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, commonly referred to as Superfund).

The Site is adjacent to the Boeing Plant 2 facility and is within the boundaries of the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site. The Jorgensen Forge Property is one of several contamination investigations and cleanups taking place in the waterway. The Jorgensen Forge Property has housed steel-related industrial operations since the 1940s. Previous investigations at the Site found high concentrations of PCBs, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel in soils, and TPH and metals in the groundwater. EPA has already taken some early cleanup actions at the Site, include the removal of PCB-contaminated sediments and river bank dirt in 2014. More information is available from the Lower Duwamish Waterway Site profile page. Background on the Jorgensen Forge Corporation Bankruptcy In May 2016, Constellation Enterprises, LLC and its subsidiary, Jorgensen, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in Delaware. In August 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of Jorgensen and its property to CE Star and its subsidiary, Star Forge (Purchasers). The court order approving the sale allowed the Purchasers to void the sale if the Purchasers did not resolve environmental matters related to the Jorgensen Forge Property to their satisfaction, which was accomplished through the BFPP Settlement.

Health and Environmental Effects Sulfur Dioxide – High concentrations of SO2 affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children and the elderly. Sulfur dioxide is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain. Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs, along with NOx, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Particulate Matter - Particle pollution, especially fine particles, contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. Exposure to such particles can affect both the lungs and heart. Numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of problems, including premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the airways, coughing, or difficulty breathing. People with heart or lung diseases, children, and older adults are the most likely to be affected by particle pollution exposure. However, even if you are healthy, you may experience temporary symptoms from exposure to elevated levels of particle pollution. Benzene - Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidences of leukemia have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene. The EPA has classified benzene as a Group A human carcinogen. Overview of Company and Location of Facility CITGO claims a total refining capacity of approximately 750,000 barrels of crude oil per day, 167,000 barrels of which is attributed to the Lemont refinery. CITGO is also one of the largest suppliers of petrochemicals in the nation; its products are primarily sold through independent marketers. The Lemont refinery is located on 900 acres that span Lemont and Romeoville, Illinois. The Lemont refinery’s operations are capable of refining heavy, sour crude oils into finished products, such as various grades of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and hydrocarbon solvents. Environmental Mitigation Projects CITGO will reduce benzene and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by installing controls for a benzene-containing waste stream that is currently uncontrolled (and not required to be controlled for the Lemont refinery to comply with applicable regulations, including the National Emission Standard for Benzene Waste Operations at 40 C.F.R. Part 61, Subpart FF). Controlling the waste stream will require CITGO to install approximately 800 feet of heat-traced piping and install and operate a pump and control valve to allow for control of the discharge rate. CITGO estimates that it will spend approximately $1.14 million to complete this project. Violations The settlement resolves alleged violations of Clean Air Act requirements, as well as requirements of CITGO’s global refinery consent decree, at the Lemont refinery: Heaters: A CITGO global refinery consent decree prohibition against the use of emission reductions resulting from that decree as netting credits and, consequently, New Source Review (NSR) permitting requirements at a number of heaters; Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit: A CITGO global refinery consent decree PM emission limit, 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts A (General Provisions) and J (Standards of Performance for Petroleum Refineries), and NSR permitting requirements; Sulfur Recovery Plant (SRP): A CITGO global refinery consent decree requirement to route or re-route all sulfur pit emissions to eliminate, control, or include and monitor them as part of the SRP’s emissions; Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) Downtime: Violations relating to requirements for continuous operation of a number of CEMS, specifically requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts A and J, and in the CITGO global refinery consent decree; Benzene-Containing Process Fluid Samples: 40 C.F.R. Part 63, Subpart H (the HON Rule) for failure to control emissions from benzene samples and purged process fluids from vacuum truck pump exhaust where vacuum trucks are used to collect such liquids and transport for disposal; Flares: Violations relating to flare operation, specifically violations of the Illinois State Implementation Plan and 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart GGG (Standards of Performance for Equipment Leaks of VOC in Petroleum Refineries); and Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR): Violations relating to LDAR requirements, specifically violations of 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts VV (Standards of Performance for Equipment Leaks of VOC in the Synthetic Organic Chemicals Manufacturing Industry) and GGG, and requirements found in the CITGO global refinery consent decree. Supplemental Environmental Projects The consent decree requires CITGO to spend $1 million on two supplemental environmental projects (SEPs) as follows: $650,000 on a fence line monitoring system for the Lemont Refinery; and $350,000 on a green lighting project in the local school district. The fence line monitoring system will include two monitoring stations to continuously measure benzene, hexane, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentrations, along with measurement and recording of meteorological parameters (i.e. wind speed, wind direction, etc.). If the fence line monitoring system detects concentrations above certain levels with wind data indicating the emissions may be originating from the Lemont Refinery, then CITGO will be required to investigate the source of the emissions and take corrective actions. The fence line monitoring system project requires use of a portable photo-ionization detector and infrared gas-imaging camera to survey both process unit equipment and storage tanks as possible sources of benzene and hexane emissions. The green lighting project is intended to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and NOx through the conversion of certain lighting fixtures into more-efficient, lower-watt, LED lighting fixtures. All lighting conversions will be performed on facilities owned and operated by the Lemont-Bromberek Consolidated School District.",42000000

Health Effects and Environmental Benefits In this case, highway motorcycles emitted excessive hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone. Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides (NOx) can cause or contribute to a variety of health problems and adverse environmental impacts, such as ground-level ozone, acid rain, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Affected populations may include children and people with lung diseases such as asthma. Exposure to these conditions can cause damage to lung tissue for people who work or exercise outside. Ground-level ozone – Ground-level ozone is formed by reactions involving hydrocarbons and NOx in the presence of sunlight. Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems, including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion. It can also worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ground-level ozone may damage vegetation and ecosystems as well. In the United States, ozone is responsible for an estimated $500 million in reduced crop production each year. Overview Suzuki Motor of America, Inc. is an American corporation that imports and distributes into the United States highway motorcycles and other vehicles from Suzuki Motor Corporation, a Japanese corporation. Violations This EPA administrative settlement resolves violations of Clean Air Act Title II and 40 CFR Part 86 concerning the manufacture, importation and sale of model year 2012 motorcycles that failed to meet the EPA average emission standard for the Suzuki on-highway motorcycle fleet. Suzuki chose to use emission averaging regulations to certify multiple engine families for sale in model year 2012, but the average emissions level for the motorcycles did not comply with the hydrocarbons plus nitrogen oxides emissions standard. Suzuki submitted falsified production reports based on incorrect motorcycle production volumes to demonstrate compliance with the emission standard. Pollutant Impacts EPA estimates that the motorcycle fleet contributed to excess emissions of over 36 metric tons of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.","2054,924"
159,Detroit Diesel Corp.,,https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/detroit-diesel-corp-clean-air-act,Consent Decree,2016-10-06,"(WASHINGTON, D.C. - October 6, 2016) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) today announced a settlement with Detroit Diesel Corp. that resolves alleged violations of the Clean Air Act for selling heavy-duty diesel engines that were not certified by EPA and did not meet applicable emission standards. Under the settlement, Detroit Diesel will spend $14.5 million on projects to reduce nitrogen oxide and other pollutants, including replacing high-polluting diesel school buses and locomotive engines with models that meet current emissions standards. Detroit Diesel will also pay a $14 million civil penalty. Settlement Resources News Release Consent Decree On this page:Overview of Company Violations Injunctive Relief Pollutant Impacts Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Environmental Justice Benefits Civil Penalty Comment Period Contact OverviewDetroit Diesel Corp. manufactures heavy duty diesel engines, axles, and transmissions for the on-highway and vocational markets. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America and is incorporated in the state of Delaware. ViolationsThe settlement resolves a U.S. EPA enforcement action against Detroit Diesel Corp. for alleged Clean Air Act violations for introducing into commerce 7,786 heavy duty diesel engines in model year 2010 that did not have valid EPA-issued certificates of conformity as required by Section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7522(a)(1) and that failed to meet 2010 emissions standards. The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires manufacturers to obtain a certificate of conformity demonstrating compliance with emission standards before introducing an engine into commerce. Certificates of conformity cover only those engines produced within a single model year. A model year for an engine family of engines ends either when the last such engine is produced, or on December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year is named, whichever date is sooner.Detroit Diesel commenced construction of the heavy duty diesel engines during model year 2009 but did not complete construction of the engines until calendar year 2010. Because Detroit Diesel completed all manufacturing and assembling processes for the engines in 2010, the engines required a certificate of conformity demonstrating compliance with 2010 emission standards.From approximately January 5, 2010 through approximately June 1, 2010, Detroit Diesel sold the engines for on-highway use in heavy duty vehicles. Because the engines were not certified to the more stringent 2010 emission standards, Detroit Diesel’s sale of these engines resulted in excess emissions. The engines were manufactured in Detroit, Michigan, but were introduced into commerce across the country. Injunctive ReliefThe consent decree requires Detroit Diesel to spend a total of $14.5 million on clean diesel projects. These clean diesel projects include:Replacing older, high-polluting school buses with new school buses that meet current, more-protective emissions standards. The amount to be spent on this project is $10.875 million. Replacing or repowering high-polluting switch locomotives, which are locomotives used in ports to move goods short distances. The amount to be spent on this project is $3.625 million. In addition, Detroit Diesel will be required to post information about these projects on a public website in order to inform the public of actions taken under this settlement. Expanding transparency by making information more accessible to the public is one component of EPA’s Next Generation Compliance. Pollutant ImpactsThe clean diesel school bus and locomotive projects will reduce diesel emissions, which include nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter, hazardous air pollutants and other pollutants. Nitrogen oxide is a precursor to ozone and can lead to acid rain. Diesel exhaust poses a lung cancer hazard for people and can cause respiratory effects such as asthma, and these risks can disproportionately impact sensitive populations such as children. Health and Environmental BenefitsThe EPA estimates that each dollar spent to reduce diesel emissions results in $13 of public health benefits. Thus, EPA estimates that $14.5 million spent on clean diesel projects could provide $188.5 million in public health benefits as the result of ambient air pollutant reductions. Also, the indoor air quality improvements (i.e., reduced exposure to diesel exhaust inside of school buses) associated with retiring high-polluting diesel school buses are expected to result in significant additional health benefits.The projects are expected to be implemented by Detroit Diesel in a manner that seeks projects across many geographic areas, emphasizes project options that reduce cost and maximize environmental benefit and prioritizes areas that are non-attainment for any pollutant or are potential low income areas. This enforcement action is part of an ongoing effort by the EPA to protect the public from harmful air pollution by ensuring that all vehicles and engines meet federal emission limits. Environmental Justice BenefitsVehicles containing the heavy duty diesel engines that failed to meet 2010 emissions standards are mobile sources of emissions, and the emissions produced do not present any unique environmental justice concerns. However, Detroit Diesel’s implementation of the clean diesel projects is expected to reduce NOx and other pollutants in areas disproportionally impacted by mobile source air pollution.Civil PenaltyDetroit Diesel Corp. will pay a $14,000,000 civil penalty.Comment PeriodThe proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.

Kodish Air Enforcement Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1595 Wynkoop Street (8MSU) Denver, CO 80202-1129kodish.jeff@epa.gov Mitigation The EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice entered into a settlement agreement with NGL on September 27, 2018, that required NGL to retire 36 million biomass-based diesel RINs to offset the harm caused by its alleged violations. Civil Penalty Western Dubuque will pay a civil penalty of $6 million. The penalty is based, in part, on the company’s limited ability to pay a larger penalty and replace RINs to offset the harm caused by the alleged violation. Overview of Company Western Dubuque owns and operates a 30 million gallon biodiesel plant located in Farley, Iowa. The company was formed in 2005 by a group of eastern Iowa farmers and business people. Health and Environmental Benefits In order to ensure the GHG emissions reductions from the RFS program are achieved, and to protect the program's integrity and maintain a level playing field for regulated companies, EPA pursues enforcement actions against renewable fuel producers and other parties involved in the generation of invalid RINs. Violations The settlement resolves an enforcement action by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) against Western Dubuque for violations of the RFS2 regulations. The EPA and the DOJ allege that in 2011, Western Dubuque entered into a series of transactions with NGL Crude Logistics, LLC (NGL), then known as Gavilon LLC, that resulted in the generation of more than 36 million invalid biomass-based diesel RINs. The allegations were as follows: NGL purchased biodiesel with RINs from other companies, separated and sold the RINs to third parties, and then sold the biodiesel to Western Dubuque as a methyl ester ""feedstock."" Methyl esters are a class of chemical compounds that include, but are not limited to, biodiesel. Western Dubuque then reprocessed this ""feedstock"" and generated a second set of RINs for the reprocessed fuel. Western Dubuque sold all of the biodiesel it produced from NGL’s “feedstock” and RINs it generated in 2011 to NGL. The EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice also allege that Western Dubuque violated a number of RFS2 prohibited acts because the RINs it generated were not produced using a qualifying feedstock or qualifying process. NGL is not a part of this settlement. The EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against NGL, and asked the court to require NGL to retire 36 million biomass-based diesel RINs to offset the harm caused by its alleged violations, and to pay a substantial civil penalty. On September 27, 2018, the EPA and U.S. Department of Justice announced a settlement agreement with NGL that required the company to pay a civil penalty of $25 million and retire 36 million biomass-based diesel RINs. See: the NGL Crude Logistics, LLC case. Pollutant Impacts Biomass-based diesel RINs represent renewable fuel that displaces petroleum diesel fuel and achieves GHG emissions reductions. When two RINs are generated for the same volume of fuel, the invalid RINs distort the actual GHG emissions achieved. This has a negative impact on the goals of the RFS program and the integrity of the RIN market. The EPA estimates that the illegal generation of RINs in this case resulted in excess greenhouse gas emissions of about 151,319 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Overview of the Renewable Fuel Standard Program The original Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS1) was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and established the first renewable fuel volume mandate in the United States. RFS1 required 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel be blended into gasoline by 2012. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the program, which became known as the RFS2 program. The RFS2 program reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting a national mandate for renewable fuels that meet specific GHG emissions reduction standards. The RFS2 regulations created a market based program to assure that the national mandate will be met. Renewable fuel producers and importers generate renewable fuel credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs, for each gallon of renewable fuel that meets the GHG emissions reduction standards. The program requires refiners and importers, known as obligated parties, to retire a specific number of RINs each year based on the amount of petroleum fuel that they produce and import. The RFS program was designed to reduce GHG emissions by 138 million metric tons when fully implemented in 2022. The reductions would be equivalent to taking about 27 million vehicles off the road.

Health and Environmental Benefits In order to ensure the GHG emissions reductions from the RFS program are achieved, and to protect the program's integrity and maintain a level playing field for regulated companies, EPA pursues enforcement actions against renewable fuel exporters, such as Chemoil that export renewable fuel but fail to retire the requisite RINs for that fuel. Failure to submit required reports to EPA are significant violations because they result in a reduced ability by EPA to know whether the renewable fuels meet specific GHG emissions reduction standards, and a negative impact on the integrity of the renewable fuels program. Overview of Company Chemoil Corporation (Chemoil) is a privately-held company, and one of the world's leading retail energy companies in sea and land sector. Chemoil sells marine, aviation, diesel, renewable fuels, and residual oil products. Chemoil is incorporated in California, and resides and does business in San Francisco, California. Violations The settlement resolves an enforcement action by EPA against Chemoil for violations of the Clean Air Act involving its failure to comply with the RFS2 requirements. EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) allege that Chemoil exported at least 48.5 million gallons of biodiesel from the United States in 2011, 2012, and 2013, without retiring the approximately 72.7 million biomass-based diesel RINs for that fuel. The EPA discovered the alleged violations as a result of tips from RFS program participants. EPA and DOJ also allege related reporting violations Pollutant Impacts The failure to retire RINs threatens the GHG emissions reductions Congress sought to achieve by requiring that the renewable fuel be used in the United States. The EPA estimates that Chemoil’s violations resulted in a failure to achieve a reduction of emissions equivalent to 305,579 metric tons of carbon dioxide in the United States. Overview of the Renewable Fuel Standard Program The original Renewable Fuel Standard program was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and established the first renewable fuel volume mandate in the United States. The program required 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuel be blended into gasoline by 2012.

The program requires refiners and importers, known as obligated parties, to retire a specific number of RINs each year based on the amount of petroleum fuel that they produce and import. Since exported renewable fuel is no longer available for use in the United States to fulfill the renewable fuel volume mandates, the program also requires exporters of renewable fuel to calculate and meet exporter renewable volume obligations that are based upon the type and volume of renewable fuel exported from the United States. The RFS program was designed to reduce GHG emissions by 138 million metric tons when fully implemented in 2022.

Under the settlement, Sears will implement a comprehensive, corporate-wide program to ensure that the contractors it hires to perform work minimize lead dust from home renovation activities. Sears will also pay a $400,000 civil penalty. Settlement Resources Consent Decree On this page: Overview of Company Violations Injunctive Relief Pollutant Reductions Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Civil Penalty Comment Period Contact Overview Sear Home Improvement Products, Inc. (SHIP) is part of the Sears Home Services division, within Sears Holdings Corporation. The Home Services division makes over 12 million service and installation calls annually through a network of 6,700 technicians and Sears’ 705 retail stores in the United States. SHIP performs the home renovation segment for Sears Homes Services through its network of third-party contractors. This work includes renovations, such as replacement of siding and windows and kitchen remodeling. A customer can purchase a home improvement product – like siding, windows, and kitchen cabinets – and contract with SHIP for its installation. SHIP does not install the product itself. Instead, it contracts with local third-party renovation specialists to perform the work. SHIP is headquartered in Longwood, Florida, does business in 45 states, and maintains 58 district offices. The headquarters of Sears Holdings Corporation is in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Violations The U.S Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule, which is a part of the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, is intended to ensure that owners and occupants of housing built before 1978, as well as any child-occupied facilities, receive information on lead-based paint hazards before renovations begin and that individuals performing such renovations are properly trained and certified by EPA and follow specific work practices to reduce the potential for lead-based paint exposure. Home improvement companies such as SHIP that contract with renovators to perform renovation work for their customers must ensure that those contractors comply with all of the requirements of the RRP Rule. The RRP Rule applies to both the retailer offering to perform the renovation and the contractor the retailer hires to renovate the property. Between 2013 and 2015, EPA made several requests of SHIP for documents related to renovations in several states. EPA later identified 71 renovation sites in California, Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia and New York where SHIP could not document its compliance with one or more of the following requirements of the RRP Rule: that assigned renovators were certified as the RRP Rule requires (a violation of 40 C.F.R. § 745.86(b)(6)); that training had been provided to workers on lead-safe practices (a violation of 40 C.F.R. § 745.86(b)(6)(i)); that work areas were properly contained (a violation of 40 C.F.R. § 745.86(b)(6)(v)); that waste was contained on-site and while being transported off-site (a violation of 40 C.F.R. § 745.86(b)(6)(vi); that the work area was properly cleaned (a violation of 40 C.F.R. § 745.86(b)(6)(vii)); that a certified renovator performed post-renovation cleaning verifications (a violation of 40 C.F.R. § 745.86(b)(6)(viii)); and that a certified renovator delivered a lead hazard information pamphlet to the owner of the home (a violation of 40 C.F.R. § 745.84(a)(1)). Additionally, EPA assessed violations at 18 renovation sites in Minnesota where SHIP failed to establish and maintain records of RRP compliance or to make RRP compliance records available to EPA (violations of 40 C.F.R. § 745.87(b)). Injunctive Relief SHIP must contract only with EPA-certified and state-certified firms and renovators, ensure they maintain certification, and ensure they use lead-safe work practices during renovations. This settlement also adds requirements to SHIP’s compliance program beyond what is required by the RRP Rule to better protect Sears customers nationwide during renovations of any housing that was built before 1978 and any child-occupied facilities. Significant elements of this program include: SHIP will require its contractors to use an enhanced Installer Renovation Recordkeeping Checklist in which contractors will certify their compliance with detailed elements of the RRP Rule; SHIP will require its contractors to provide the completed and signed Checklist to customers; SHIP will not issue final payment to a contractor for a renovation until the contractor has provided SHIP a completed Checklist, including certification that the contractor made the Checklist available to the customer; SHIP will add a link on its website to a page on EPA’s website that discusses lead-safe work practices; SHIP will use a company-wide system to actively track the RRP firm and renovator certifications of its contractors; and SHIP will suspend anyone that is not operating in compliance with the RRP Rule, investigate all reports of potential noncompliance, and ensure that any violations are corrected. EPA reached a similar settlement with home improvement retailer Lowe’s Home Centers in 2014 requiring the company to implement a comprehensive, corporate-wide compliance program at its over 1,700 stores nationwide to ensure that the contractors it hires to perform work minimize lead dust from home renovation activities. Pollutant Impacts Even though lead-based paint was banned in 1978, it still remains in many homes and apartments across the country. According to HUD’s American Healthy Homes Survey, which was conducted from June 2005 through March 2006, an estimated 37.1 million homes – or 34.9 percent of all homes nationwide - have lead-based paint somewhere in the building. An estimated 34.4 million of these homes were built before 1978. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Lead dust can occur when lead paint deteriorates or is disrupted during home renovation and remodeling activities. Lead exposure can cause a range of health problems, from behavioral disorders and learning disabilities to seizures and death, putting young children at the greatest risk because their nervous systems are still developing. EPA enforces the RRP and other lead rules to protect children and others who are vulnerable to exposure to lead dust that can cause lead poisoning. A blood lead test is the only way to determine if a child has a high lead level. Parents who think their child has been in contact with lead dust should contact their child's health care provider. Renovation firms that are certified under EPA’s RRP Rule are encouraged to display EPA’s “Lead-Safe” logo on workers’ uniforms, signs, websites and other material, as appropriate. Consumers can protect themselves by looking for the logo before hiring a renovation firm. Consumers can learn more about the RRP Rule and hiring a certified firm by calling the National Lead Information Center at 1 (800) 424-LEAD or visiting www.epa.gov/lead. Civil Penalty SHIP will pay a civil penalty of $400,000. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. The government will publish a notice of the settlement in the Federal Register and give the public thirty days to comment on it. EPA and DOJ will review the comments and make a recommendation to the Court based on their assessment of the comments received. The standard for entry of a consent decree is whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, consistent with applicable law, and in the public interest.

EPA looks forward to working with our federal and state partners to clean up the site and restore the Little Beaver Creek watershed.” Information about the Nease Chemical Superfund Site The 44-acre Nease Chemical Site is located near Salem in Columbiana County, Ohio. Between 1961 and 1973, Nease Chemical produced various chemical compounds, including household cleaning compounds, fire retardants and pesticides, most notably Mirex, a probable human carcinogen. Facility operations contaminated soil and groundwater with hazardous substances. Surface water runoff also carried contamination into the Middle Fork of Little Beaver Creek, which is an important natural resource in the region. The site was placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) on 9/30/83. More information about this site is available from the Nease Chemical Superfund site profile sheet. Comment Period The Rutgers consent decree, filed on September 9, 2016 with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, was subject to a 30-day public comment period.

Rutgers also agrees to implement EPA’s Operable Unit 3 cleanup remedy at the site by removing contaminated sediment and floodplain soil and replacing it with clean material. The total cleanup, including long term operations and maintenance, is estimated to cost $18.75 million. The contamination released from the chemical plant has injured natural resources in and around the site, including the underlying groundwater aquifers which have become unusable as a source of potable water. As part of the settlement, Rutgers will remove a low-head dam, known as the Lisbon Dam on the MFLBC, and restore adjacent streamside habitat, which is expected to help establish a free-flowing stream with a healthy and diverse fish population. Rutgers will also fund a $366,000 trust to conserve a variety of lands in the Little Beaver Creek watershed, especially lands that are subject to pressures from new development in the area, to help provide valuable habitat. The trust will also seek to conserve property to protect local drinking water source areas from further contamination. Finally, Rutgers will reimburse the federal and state agencies for their past response and assessment costs, totaling approximately $1 million, and will reimburse the agencies for all future oversight and assessment costs. Information on pollutants and environmental effects The primary contaminant in the soil is Mirex, a pesticide and fire retardant. Studies of the creek showed contamination of fish, sediments, and adjacent floodplains with Mirex. The Ohio Department of Health issued a health advisory against fishing and swimming along certain portions of the creek in the late 1980s. Dairy herds on a few nearby farms were also potentially affected by Mirex through exposure to creek and floodplain contamination. Access restrictions appear to have been effective, and Mirex has not been detected in dairy herds. A 2004 endangerment assessment indicated no unacceptable human health risks at that time, although exposure to contaminants in the future could pose unacceptable risks.

Public comment was also received on a prior version of this settlement, which was announced in August 2016. For more information, contact: Evan Belser, Chief Vehicle and Engine Enforcement Branch Air Enforcement Division Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Washington, DC 20460belser.evan@epa.gov Civil Penalty Harley-Davidson will pay a $12 million civil penalty. Injunctive Relief Under the settlement, Harley-Davidson: will immediately stop selling the tuners, buy back all of the tuners in stock at their dealerships and destroy the tuners. obtain certification from the California Air Resources Board for any tuners it sells in the future. These certifications will demonstrate that new tuners do not cause their motorcycles to exceed their certified emissions limits. will conduct tests on tuner-equipped motorcycles and provide the results to EPA to guarantee that their motorcycles remain in compliance with EPA certification requirements for emissions. will also ensure that all of its future motorcycle models intended for sale in the United States are fully certified by EPA. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Exposure to ozone and particulate matter pollution has been linked with a range of serious health effects, including increased asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses. Exposure to these pollutants has also been associated with premature death due to respiratory-related or cardiovascular-related effects. Children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing respiratory disease are particularly at risk of health effects from exposure to these pollutants. By reducing the chance that Harley-Davidson motorcycles produce emissions above their legally certified levels, this agreement contributes to state and federal efforts to meet air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. Overview of Company Harley-Davidson, Inc., founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903, is the largest American manufacturer of motorcycles. It is the world's fifth largest motorcycle manufacturer. In the U.S., Harley-Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Kansas City, Missouri. Violations EPA alleges that Harley-Davidson violated the Clean Air Act by manufacturing and selling about 340,000 devices, known as tuners, that allow users to change how a motorcycle’s engine functions. These changes can cause the motorcycles to emit higher amounts of certain air pollutants than they would in the original configuration that Harley-Davidson certified with EPA. Harley-Davidson also manufactured and sold more than 12,000 motorcycles that EPA alleges did not undergo proper EPA certification to ensure they meet federal clean air standards. Pollutant Impacts Prior to the settlement, Harley-Davidson manufactured and sold two types of tuners, which when hooked up to Harley-Davidson motorcycles, allow users to modify certain aspects of a motorcycles’ emissions control system. These modified settings increase power and performance, but also increase the motorcycles’ emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Hydrocarbon and NOx emissions contribute to harmful ground-level ozone, and NOx also contributes to fine particulate matter pollution.",$12 million

Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Pollutant Reductions The injunctive relief measures provided for in the consent decree will drastically reduce total dissolved solids by more than 2.5 million pounds on an annual basis. State Role The State of Pennsylvania is a co-plaintiff in this case. Civil Penalty Under the consent decree, Consol will also pay a civil penalty of $3 million, split between the U.S. and Pennsylvania. Health and Environmental Effects Mining can have significant environmental and human health consequences. Mining discharges can impair streams and watersheds. Sediment-laden runoff can result in increased turbidity and dissolved oxygen in receiving waters, which in turn can result in loss of in-stream habitat for fish and other aquatic species. Sediment can kill fish directly, destroy spawning beds, suffocate fish eggs and bottom dwelling organisms, and block sunlight resulting in reduced growth of beneficial aquatic grasses. Excess levels of metals commonly found in mining discharges, such as iron and aluminum, can be toxic to fish by disrupting metabolic and reproductive systems. Precipitation of these metals can destroy habitat needed by macro invertebrates. Osmotic pressure is based on the level of dissolved salts and other constituents in the water. Increased levels of salts, as measured by osmotic pressure, disrupt the life cycle of freshwater aquatic organisms. Freshwater animals can be exposed directly through their gills or other breathing surfaces. Some freshwater plants and animals can adjust to saltier waters, but many are unable to cope with extreme ranges of salinity.

The Bailey, Enlow Fork, and Harvey mines are large underground bituminous coal mines that are adjacent to each other and share a common coal preparation plant and coal refuse disposal areas. Violations From 2005 to 2012, the Bailey Mine Complex in Pennsylvania (one of the largest mines in the United States), reported over 5,300 days of violation of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit limits. Most of the violations were of osmotic pressure limits, a water quality-based parameter included in Pennsylvania NPDES permits that estimates the effect of dissolved constituents in the water (primarily salts) on aquatic life. Approximately 90 percent of those violations were due to discharges associated with the coal preparation and refuse disposal areas at the Bailey Mine Complex.","5.3 million, 3 million"

The approved budget amendment included 59 stormwater positions, an allocation of $7.6 million in new stormwater equipment, and additional funding for stormwater related training, operations, and travel. NDOT continues to make significant progress on stormwater enhancements in the field. Stormwater improvement projects recently completed or currently under construction add up to over $33 million in expenditures, and nearly $15 million is allotted for projects scheduled for 2016-2017. In addition, Nevada enacted new legislation which granted NDOT’s director new powers to enforce discharge permitting requirements. These new enforcement powers authorize the director to conduct an independent investigation of any act that may constitute an unauthorized discharge onto a state highway, within a right-of-way or into, onto, or by way of a conveyance system or for a violation of an encroachment permit issued by the director. The legislation empowers the director to impose a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day for any violation and further provides that the director may request that the Nevada Attorney General institute a criminal prosecution of the violation. In addition, the legislation established an Advisory Committee on Transportational Storm Water Management to enhance transparency and communications with affected stakeholders. The consent decree requires NDOT to fully comply with all requirements of the Clean Water Act, including all terms and conditions of its NPDES MS4 permit. The consent decree requires specified revisions to the following programs which are part of NDOT’s stormwater management plan: Public stormwater education Employee training Construction site runoff control Post-construction stormwater management Illicit discharge detection and elimination Storm sewer system operation and maintenance Operation and maintenance of NDOT’s maintenance facilities Next Generation Compliance measures will be taken to help address NDOT’s storm sewer system operation and maintenance program. NDOT is proposing to use unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor and evaluate the maintenance needs of at least five retention basins located in remote areas. NDOT will also post its stormwater management plan and annual reports on a public webpage. These measures, in addition to the supplemental environmental project (SEP) described below, fulfill the goals of Next Generation Compliance by including transparency, advanced monitoring, advanced real-time monitoring, and good use of advanced monitoring data. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. For More Information, Contact: Susan D. Bruce Environmental Engineer Water Enforcement Division Office of Civil Enforcement, US EPA 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460 202-564-8329bruce.susan@epa.gov Civil Penalty NDOT will pay a civil penalty of $120,000 and develop and implement a SEP valued at $200,000. The SEP involves advanced water quality monitoring at three locations and posting of real-time monitoring data on a public website. Health and Environmental Effects Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through MS4s and ultimately discharged untreated into local rivers, lakes, and streams. Roads and highways discharge metals, phosphorous, nitrogen, sediment, and suspended particles, grease, and salt. Urban roadways also discharge trash and significant amounts of bacteria. Illicit discharges can enter the MS4 through direct connections (e.g., wastewater piping either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the MS4) or indirect connections (e.g., infiltration into the MS4, spills collected by storm drains, or paint or used oil dumped directly into a storm drain). The result is untreated discharges that contribute high levels of pollutants, including heavy metals, toxics, oil and grease, solvents, nutrients, viruses, and bacteria to receiving waters. When discharged into nearby waterways through MS4s, these pollutants can degrade water quality, thereby discouraging recreational uses, contaminating drinking water supplies, and adversely impacting fish and other wildlife. In addition, an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces (e.g., new or widened roads) resulting from new development can impact waterbodies by increasing the quantity and velocity of water delivered to the waterbodies during storms. This can result in streambank scouring and erosion and downstream flooding which can harm aquatic life and damage property. The stormwater NPDES permit program requires municipalities to develop and implement a program to improve the quality of local waterways by reducing the amount of pollutants that stormwater runoff and melting snow pick up and carry into storm sewer systems. Overview of Company and Location of Sites The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) operates a Phase I municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) that serves NDOT roadways and facilities across the State of Nevada. The NDOT MS4 is an expansive system, with more than 1,000 bridges and 5,400 miles of highway. NDOT is authorized under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to discharge stormwater to waters of the United States through its MS4 provided it complies with all provisions of the permit. Violations NDOT failed to develop and implement an adequate stormwater management plan that fully complied with the terms and conditions of its NPDES permit in violation of Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. Specific deficiencies include failure to: Assess and control discharges into impaired waters; Map major outfalls discharging to waters of the U.S.; Develop and implement a stormwater education program; Develop and implement a program to detect and eliminate illicit discharges; and Develop and implement programs to control discharges from NDOT’s own maintenance and construction activities.","120,000"

Of the total civil penalty amount, $1,290,000 will be paid to the United States and $400,000 will be paid to the Knox County Air Pollution Control District, Knox County, Tennessee, a signatory under the decree. Injunctive Relief The settlement covers five Cemex plants and a total of seven kilns, located in several states: Knoxville, Tennessee; Demopolis, Alabama; Louisville, Kentucky; New Braunfels, Texas; and Odessa, Texas. The settlement requires Cemex to install and continuously operate modern pollution controls for nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions at its kilns. Specifically, the consent decree requires that Cemex install a selective non-catalytic reduction system (SNCR) for controlling NOX at seven kilns, and meet stringent emission rates at each kiln. For the control of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, Cemex will rely on inherent scrubbing provided by kiln operation and a low-emissions baseline for SO2. Also, Cemex will be required to operate and maintain certified emission monitors for NOX and SO2 at all seven kilns under this settlement. The decree also requires Cemex to conduct detailed diagnostic energy audits at all facilities covered under the consent decree and spend $150,000 in mitigation dollars on energy efficient projects that reduce NOX emissions.

Affected populations include children and people with lung diseases such as asthma. Exposure to these conditions can cause damage to lung tissue for people who work or exercise outside. High concentrations of SO2 can affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children, and the elderly. SO2 is also a primary contributor to acid rain. Overview of Company Cemex, Inc. (Cemex) is a Louisiana corporation, and maintains its corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas. Cemex is one of the largest producers of Portland cement in the United States, owning and operating 12 cement manufacturing plants. Violations The United States alleges in its Complaint that on more than one occasion, Cemex failed to obtain pre-construction permits and install and operate the appropriate nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) control technology for major modifications at one or more of its cement manufacturing plants that resulted in significant emissions increases. The changes violated requirements contained in Section 165(a) of the Clean Air Act, regulations set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 52.21, and the corresponding state regulations in state implementation plans (SIPs). EPA’s regional offices in Atlanta (Region 4) and Dallas (Region 6) issued notices of violations (NOVs) for the modifications to the Knoxville, Tennessee and Odessa, Texas plants, respectively. Pollutant Impacts This settlement is part of EPA’s National Enforcement Initiative to control harmful emissions from large sources of pollution, which includes cement manufacturing plants, under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements. The total NOX emission reductions from the settlement are over 4,000 tons. The settlement requires that Cemex maintain the already-low SO2 emissions at current rates or better.","1690,000"
176,Enbridge Clean Water Act Settlement," (Washington, DC - July 20, 2016)  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Justice today announced a settlement with Enbridge Energy Limited Partnership and several related Enbridge companies to resolve claims stemming from its 2010 oil spills in Marshall, Mich. and Romeoville, Ill. Enbridge has agreed to spend at least $110 million on a series of measures to prevent spills and improve operations across nearly 2,000 miles of its pipeline system in the Great Lakes region. Enbridge will also pay civil penalties totaling $62 million for Clean Water Act violations -- $61 million for discharging at least 20,082 barrels of oil in Marshall and $1 million for discharging at least 6,427 barrels of oil in Romeoville. On January 19, 2017, the United States filed a motion to enter as a final judgment a revised consent decree. Following the public comment period, the parties agreed to make four changes to the proposed consent decree. One change clarifies that replacement of a pipeline, known as “Original US Line 3,” is conditioned on Enbridge obtaining all permits and authorizations needed for the replacement project, which was always the intended effect of the consent decree. Another change bars re-use of Original US Line 3 in the event that the replacement projected is approved and completed. Finally, there are two technical corrections to appendices to the proposed consent decree. For more information on the revised consent decree and incorporating the changes outlined above.

Jackson Blvd. Chicago, IL 60604 moore.johnm@epa.gov (312) 353-5624 Civil Penalty Enbridge paid a civil penalty of $61 million for the Marshall spill and $1 million for the Romeoville spill. Health and Environmental Effects The injunctive relief required by the settlement to improve Enbridge’s spill prevention, leak detection, data integration, and oil spill preparedness and response are designed both to prevent the likelihood of a future oil spill, and to minimize the adverse effects of a spill if it should happen. Oil spills are known to cause both immediate and long-term harm to human health and ecosystems. Oil limits oxygen in water and can suffocate wildlife. Oil emulsions may stick to the gills of fish or coat and destroy algae or other plankton. Floating oil may reduce water exposure to the circulation of oxygen and, in conjunction with emulsified oil, interfere with photosynthesis. Oil slicks can kill birds, contaminate food sources, reduce animal and plant reproduction and contaminate nesting habitats. Oil spills can cause long-term effects years later even if the oil remains in the environment for a relatively short period of time. Petroleum oils can also undergo oxidation and polymerization reactions and can form tars that persist in the environment for years. Overview of Company The Enbridge companies who are defendants in this case own or operate the Enbridge Mainline System – one of the world’s largest pipeline systems with more than 3,000 miles of pipeline corridors in the United States and Canada. Enbridge’s Mainline System is the single largest conduit of liquid petroleum into the United States, delivering on-average 1.7 million barrels of products each day. The portion of the Mainline System within the United States is known as the Lakehead Pipeline System (Lakehead System) and includes a network of pipelines that are grouped within right-of-ways that collectively span 1,900 miles from the international border near Neche, North Dakota to delivery points in the Midwest, New York, and Ontario. Violations On or about July 25, 2010, at least 20,082 barrels (843,444 gallons) of oil discharged from Enbridge’s Line 6B pipeline in Marshall Michigan. Oil entered Talmadge Creek and the Kalamazoo River and adjoining shorelines, in a quantity as may be harmful. The discharge was the result of a pipeline rupture due to stress corrosion cracking downstream from a pump station and control room errors when personnel misinterpreted leak alarms and restarted the pipeline without confirming whether there was a pipeline failure. On or about September 9, 2010, at least 6,427 barrels (269,934 gallons) of oil discharged from Enbridge’s Line 6A pipeline near Romeoville, Illinois. Oil entered an unnamed tributary to the Des Plaines River and adjoining shorelines in a quantity as may be harmful. Enbridge contends that this spill happened when a third-party water pipe in the right of way failed, causing a water spout that damaged the Enbridge pipeline. Pollutant Impacts As a result of the Marshall discharges, at least 20,082 barrels (843,444 gallons) of oil entered the environment. The Kalamazoo River was closed in places over a three-year period while Enbridge engaged in an extensive cleanup effort in accordance with a series of orders issued by EPA under Section 311(c) of CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1321(c), starting with an initial order issued on July 26, 2010. Such cleanup efforts included, among other things, dredging sections of the Kalamazoo River downstream as far as 38 miles from the confluence of Talmadge Creek. As a result of the Romeoville discharge, at least 6,427 barrels (269,934 gallons) of oil entered the environment. The oil entered a storm drain and an unnamed tributary that flows to the Des Plaines River and into a sanitary sewer system forcing the shutdown of the Village of Romeoville South Water Treatment Plant.",61 million

Health Effects and Environmental Effects Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function. Sulfur Dioxide – High concentrations of SO2 affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children and the elderly. Sulfur dioxide is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain. Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs, along with NOX, play a major role in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone, which is the primary constituent of smog. People with lung disease, children, older adults, and people who are active can be affected when ozone levels are unhealthy. Ground-level ozone exposure is linked to a variety of short-term health problems, including lung irritation and difficulty breathing, as well as long-term problems, such as permanent lung damage from repeated exposure, aggravated asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Hazardous Air Pollutants – HAPs, also known as toxic air pollutants or air toxics, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. Benzene is a HAP. Greenhouse Gases – The release of GHGs into the atmosphere traps heat. The continued release of GHGs at or above the current rate will increase average temperatures around the globe. Increases in global temperatures will most likely change our planet’s climate in ways that will have significant long-term effects on people and the environment. Overview of Companies The consent decree covers refineries located in Kenai, Alaska; Martinez, California; Kapolei, Hawaii; Mandan, North Dakota; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Anacortes, Washington. Tesoro Corp., is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, and its subsidiaries, Tesoro Alaska Company LLC, Tesoro Logistics L.P., and Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company LLC operate five of the six refineries covered by this settlement.

Construction of the dikes facilitated the changed flow of the Wind River from its north channel to its south channel, which rendered over 300 acres of tribal land inaccessible to the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone Tribes (“Tribes”) and impacted the health of fisheries and wildlife habitat in the area. In 2004, Mr. Hubenka was criminally convicted of violating CWA Section 301 for knowingly discharging pollutants into waters of the United States without a permit at three locations. He was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to remove the three dikes and restore the riverbed. Mr. Hubenka obtained release from his probation, but never removed the three dikes from the river. In order to obtain relief, the United States filed a civil complaint against Mr. Hubenka in 2010. The civil complaint sought injunctive relief and civil penalties for illegal discharges associated with the construction of four dikes – the three dikes at issue in the criminal case and a fourth dike discovered after the criminal indictment. Shortly thereafter, the Tribes joined the case as Plaintiff-Intervenors, and in 2011, the United States filed an amended civil complaint naming LID as an additional defendant based on LID’s role in the illegal discharges associated with the construction of one of the dikes. The case was the subject of a two-week trial in 2012. In 2014, the court ruled in favor of the United States and the Tribes, ordering removal of the dikes, restoration of the riverbed, and civil penalties. Injunctive Relief The injunctive relief requirements of the settlement agreement will restore channel alignment of the Wind River and reposition flow back into its north channel. The injunctive relief requirements will also repair floodplain ecology on the banks of the north channel and accelerate passive restoration of riparian lands and wetlands lost or damaged within the south channel. Under the settlement agreement, responsibility for restoration of the Wind River is as follows: Dike 1 – The Northern Arapaho Tribe will use money, paid by LID’s insurance company, to perform the restoration work associated with Dike 1. This work includes the construction of a rock revetment to restore the right bank alignment of the Wind River and restoration of channel profile, geometry, and historic flow in the north channel. Dike 2 – Mr. Hubenka will perform the restoration activities associated with Dike 2. This work includes removing the remaining material comprising Dike 2 and restoring a flat bench within the dike footprint at the elevation of the adjacent vegetated floodplain. It also includes restoration of the enlarged southern channel adjacent to Dike 2, which will effectively restore the floodplain and functionality of the north channel in that area. Dike 3 – Mr. Hubenka will perform the restoration activities associated with Dike 3. This work includes removing the remaining material comprising Dike 3 and restoring a flat floodplain to a specified design elevation. Some of the removed material will be used to enlarge a point bar on the riverbank upstream of the dike where channel width is excessive. Mr. Hubenka will also remove a depositional bar that has formed adjacent to the north channel across from Dike 3. Dike 4 – Mr. Hubenka will perform the restoration activities associated with Dike 4. This work includes removing the remaining material comprising Dike 4 and restoring a flat floodplain to a specified design elevation. The Northern Arapaho Tribe will also perform supplementary activities intended to restore floodplain ecology on the banks of the north channel of the Wind River and to accelerate passive restoration of riparian lands and wetlands lost or impaired within the south channel. Comment Period On July 11, 2016, the parties in the CWA civil judicial case, filed a joint motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming, asking the court to enter a proposed order, negotiated among the parties, amending the court’s opinion and judgment. The proposed order is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice website. Pollutant Reductions In CWA cases involving the unauthorized discharge of dredged and/or fill material, EPA measures pollution reduction based on the number of acres mitigated for wetlands or the number of linear feet mitigated for streams. The injunctive relief requirements in the settlement agreement will mitigate the impacts caused by Mr. Hubenka and LID to approximately 15,840 linear feet of stream. Consequently, the pollutant reduction in this case is 15,840 linear feet. For more information, contact: Wendy Silver Senior Attorney U.S. EPA, Region 8 (8ENF-L) 1595 Wynkoop St. Denver, CO 80202-1129 (303) 312-6637silver.wendy@epa.gov Civil Penalty Within 30 days of entry of the settlement, Mr. Hubenka is required to pay civil penalty of $4,250. If Mr. Hubenka fails to execute completion of all his restoration obligations by December 15, 2016, he will be required to pay an additional $38,250 due by December 31, 2016. Health and Environmental Effects To protect our water resources, the CWA generally requires projects like dikes and dams to be reviewed in advance to determine whether they should be permitted, and if so, with what protective measures. The Corps typically performs this review to ensure that the proposed construction does not harm the existing water body, its fish and other aquatic life, or the interests of people who live nearby who could be adversely affected by unpermitted alterations. In this case, construction of the dikes, which altered the flow of the Wind River from its north channel to its south channel, cut off tribal access to grazing lands and precluded other tribal uses such as fishing and hunting. It also resulted in an extensive loss of riparian lands, including wetlands, due to erosion. The destroyed riparian area caused a loss of wildlife habitat and degradation of downstream water quality. Company Overview The settlement agreement in this matter resolves a Clean Water Act (“CWA”) civil judicial action against John Hubenka and LeClair Irrigation District (“LID”) for unlawful discharges into the Wind River in Fremont County, Wyoming. LID operates an irrigation system that diverts water from the Wind River. Mr. Hubenka was employed by LID as its operations manager from approximately 1986 through 2011. The impacted portion of the Wind River is located approximately 18 miles upstream from Riverton, Wyoming and south of land owned Mr. Hubenka. In addition to resolving the CWA civil judicial action, the settlement agreement also resolves litigation in the Shoshone and Arapaho Tribal Court and in the District Court of Wyoming on related matters.

182,Volkswagen Clean Air Act Civil Settlement," (Washington, D.C.) -  Through a series of three partial settlements, the EPA has resolved a civil enforcement case against Volkswagen AG, Audi AG, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., Volkswagen Group of America Chattanooga Operations, LLC, and Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (collectively “Volkswagen”).  On October 25, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Northern California approved the first partial settlement with certain of these Volkswagen entities addressing vehicles containing 2.0 liter diesel engines (the “2.0 liter partial settlement”). On May 17, 2017, the court approved the second partial settlement addressing vehicles containing 3.0 liter diesel engines (the “3.0 liter partial settlement”). Third, on April 13, 2017 the court approved the third partial settlement addressing civil penalties and injunctive relief to prevent future violations (the “third partial settlement”). These settlements resolve allegations that Volkswagen violated the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) by the sale of approximately 590,000 model year 2009 to 2016 diesel motor vehicles equipped with “defeat devices.”  The EPA alleged that these vehicles are equipped with defeat devices in the form of computer software designed to cheat on federal emissions tests. The major excess pollutant at issue in this case is oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and is a serious health concern. Concurrent with the third partial settlement the United States Department of Justice resolved a criminal case against Volkswagen AG with a plea agreement for the offenses of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and entry of goods by false statement; and the United States Customs and Border Protection resolved civil fraud claims with Volkswagen arising from the illegal importation of affected vehicles.

Volkswagen’s specific obligations for these vehicles differ depending on the technology generation of the vehicles – referred to as the generation 1 or the generation 2 vehicles. Volkswagen must meet the 85 percent recall rate for the generation 1 affected 3.0 liter vehicles by November 30, 2019, and the generation 2 affected 3.0 liter vehicles by May 31, 2020. VW must also meet separate 85 percent recall rates in California. If VW fails to reach the 85 percent recall rate for the generation 1 vehicles, VW must pay additional funds into the mitigation trust in an amount equal to $5.5 million for each percentage point by which it fell short of the national recall target, and $900,000 for each percentage point by which it fell short of the California recall target. If VW fails to reach the 85 percent recall rate for the generation 2 vehicles, VW must pay additional funds into the mitigation trust in an amount equal to $21 million for each percentage point by which it fell short of the national recall target, and $5.5 million for each percentage point by which it fell short of the California recall target. Under two related settlements concurrently approved by the court, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stipulated order and a class action settlement agreement, Volkswagen has also agreed to pay eligible consumers compensation for alleged consumer damages related to marketing and sale of the 3.0 liter vehicles with defeat devices. Vehicle owners and lessees will receive updated information from Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche concerning their available buyback or modification options, and can also obtain information about these options at: www.VWCourtSettlement.com and www.AudiCourtSettlement.com. 3.0 Liter Generation 2 Vehicles In order to achieve the 85 percent recall rate for the 3.0 liter generation 2 vehicles, Volkswagen must recall and modify these vehicles so that the vehicles meet their certified exhaust emissions standards, if such a technical solution is approved by EPA and CARB. If EPA and CARB approve such an emissions compliant recall, VW must provide consumers with a clear and accurate description regarding all impacts of the emissions compliant recall on the vehicle, including emissions levels as compared with the limits to which the vehicles were originally certified, and any impacts on fuel economy or vehicle maintenance. Any modified vehicle will also be covered by an extended warranty covering the emissions control system. In the unlikely event that Volkswagen is unable to return generation 2 vehicles to their certified exhaust emissions standards, Volkswagen must offer to buy back the generation 2 vehicles or terminate leases at no cost to the customer. In this circumstance, Volkswagen could also seek approval of an emissions modification plan to reduce the emissions from these generation 2 vehicles. The affected 3.0 liter generation 2 diesel vehicles eligible for an emissions compliant recall, pending EPA and CARB approval, are: - Model year 2013 – 2015 Audi Q7 - Model year 2014 – 2016 Audi A6, A7, A8, Q5 - Model year 2013­­ – 2016 Porsche Cayenne - Model year 2013 – 2016 VW Toureg State and Regional Partners The State of California, on behalf of its California Air Resource Board and the California Attorney General, joined the United States in both the 2.0 liter partial settlement and the 3.0 liter partial settlement. For more information, contacts: Volkswagen Case Team Air Enforcement Division U.S. EPA 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Mail Code 2242A Washington, DC 20460VW_settlement@epa.gov Mitigation The CAA 2.0 liter partial settlement required Volkswagen to fund a $2.7 billion mitigation trust fund. Under the CAA 3.0 liter partial settlement, Volkswagen contributed an additional $225 million in funding to the mitigation trust fund. There are two mitigation trust agreements created pursuant to the settlement: one for states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia and one for federally recognized Indian tribes. The trusts are being administered by Wilmington Trust, an independent trustee. The purpose of the mitigation trusts is to fund eligible mitigation actions that replace diesel emission sources with cleaner technology, thereby offsetting the excess emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) caused by the violating 2.0 and 3.0 liter vehicles. The settlement is structured to provide the states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and federally recognized Indian tribes with the ability to select and implement appropriate mitigation actions funded by Volkswagen. All 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia have elected to become beneficiaries. Each state, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia will receive a specific allocation of funds that can be used for any of the listed eligible mitigation actions. The allocation structure is primarily based on the number of registered affected Volkswagen vehicles within the boundaries of the beneficiary. The Tribes have a separate process for becoming a beneficiary, pursuant to the tribal mitigation trust agreement. For more information on the tribal trust, please visit http://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/volkswagensettlement/. Eligible mitigation actions include projects to reduce NOx from heavy duty diesel sources. Eligible projects include the replacement or repower of medium and heavy-duty trucks, school and transit buses. Other eligible mitigation actions include engine repower for freight switcher locomotives, ferries, tugs, forklifts, and port cargo handling equipment. Beneficiaries may also install ocean going vessel shorepower. Eligible mitigation actions may also include, in a more limited capacity, charging infrastructure for light duty zero emission passenger vehicles. Beneficiaries may also use trust funding on DERA state and tribal grants. Beneficiaries have the flexibility to choose which projects on the list of eligible mitigation actions are the best options for their citizens. Any member of the public interested in specific eligible mitigation actions should contact their state or tribal lead agency. The National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) and the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) compiled a list of state lead agencies. A tribal lead agency is designated when the tribe becomes a certified beneficiary to the trust. The Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) may be able to assist in identifying tribal lead agencies for beneficiaries. Their website can be found at http://www7.nau.edu/itep/main/volkswagensettlement/Index. CAA 2.0 Liter Partial Settlement Under the CAA 2.0 liter partial settlement, Volkswagen must remove from commerce in the United States or perform an approved emissions modification on at least 85 percent of the affected 2.0 liter vehicles by June 2019. VW must also meet a separate 85 percent recall rate in California. If VW fails to reach the 85 percent recall rate, VW must pay additional funds into the mitigation trust in an amount equal to $85 million for each percentage point by which it fell short of the national recall target, and $13.5 million for each percentage point by which it fell short of the California recall target. In order to achieve the 85 percent recall rate, Volkswagen must offer owners and lessees of the vehicles the opportunity to have their vehicles bought back by Volkswagen at a fair replacement value of the vehicle as of September 17, 2015, or to have their leases terminated at no cost. This buyback or lease termination option will be available to consumers for two years. Additionally, if Volkswagen proposes an emissions modification to EPA and California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the agencies approve it, Volkswagen must also offer owners and lessees the option of an emissions modification. The EPA and CARB will assess any proposed emissions modification according to detailed requirements including a substantial reduction in NOx emissions. Any approved emission modification will require extensive testing by Volkswagen and may include both software changes and new hardware. If approved, an emissions modification will reduce NOx emissions from the vast majority of vehicles by approximately 80 to 90 percent compared to their original condition. VW must provide consumers with an emissions modification disclosure that has been approved by EPA and CARB and that contains a clear and accurate description regarding all impacts of the emissions modification on the vehicle, including emissions levels as compared with the limits to which the vehicles were originally certified, and any impacts on fuel economy or vehicle maintenance. Any modified vehicle will also be covered by an extended warranty covering the emissions control system. On January 6, 2017, the EPA and CARB approved Volkswagen’s proposed emissions modification for the following 2.0 liter vehicles: - model year 2015 Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat diesel vehicles, and - model year 2015 Audi A3 diesel vehicles. On May 19, 2017, the EPA and CARB approved Volkswagen’s proposed emissions modification for the following 2.0 liter vehicles: - model year 2012, 2013 and 2014 Volkswagen Passat diesel vehicles with automatic transmissions. On July 27, 2017, the EPA and CARB approved Volkswagen’s proposed emissions modification for the following 2.0 liter vehicles: - model year 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta SportWagen diesel vehicles; - model year 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 Volkswagen Golf diesel vehicles; - model year 2013 and 2014 Volkswagen Beetle and Beetle Convertible diesel vehicles; and - model year 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 Audi A3 diesel vehicles. Further information on the details of the approved emissions modifications, as well as information about consumer options can be found at www.VWCourtSettlement.com and www.AudiCourtSettlement.com. Volkswagen may resell or export vehicles that are bought back or for which the lease is terminated only after performing an EPA and CARB approved emission modification. If there is no approved emissions modification, the vehicles will be recycled or scrapped. Under two related settlements concurrently approved by the court, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stipulated order and a class action settlement agreement, Volkswagen has also agreed to pay eligible consumers compensation for alleged consumer damages related to marketing and sale of the 2.0 liter vehicles with defeat devices. Volkswagen estimates that the total cost of achieving the 85 percent recall rate required under the CAA 2.0 liter partial settlement, and concurrently satisfying the FTC stipulated order and class action settlement agreement, will be up to $10.033 billion. Certain consumer notices and the claims administration for the buyback and lease termination program for 2.0 liter vehicles have been coordinated and consolidated with the FTC order and related class action settlement. Further information on those settlements is available for consumers at www.VWCourtSettlement.com and www.AudiCourtSettlement.com Vehicle Recall Civil Penalty Under the third partial settlement, Volkswagen has paid a $1.45 billion civil penalty for the alleged civil violations of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the Settlement Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Investment The CAA 2.0 liter partial settlement requires Volkswagen to invest $2 billion in ZEV charging infrastructure and in the promotion of ZEVs. The ZEV investments required by the CAA 2.0 liter partial settlement are intended to address the fact that consumers purchased these illegal vehicles under the mistaken belief that such vehicles were lower-emitting than others. Electrify America, LLC, was created by Volkswagen Group of America to implement this requirement. As part of the settlement, Volkswagen has submitted and will continue to submit as required a series of National ZEV Investment plans to EPA for review and approval based on criteria detailed in the consent decree. The settlement also requires that Volkswagen submit ZEV investment plans to California for the money to be spent in that state. The plans can be found here: https://www.electrifyamerica.com/our-plan. The CAA 3.0 liter partial settlement does not include any additional ZEV investment requirements. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits NOx pollution contributes to the formation of harmful smog and soot, exposure to which is linked to a number of respiratory- and cardiovascular-related health effects as well as premature death. Children, older adults, people who are active outdoors (including outdoor workers), and people with heart or lung disease are particularly at risk for health effects related to smog or soot exposure. Nitrogen dioxide formed by NOx emissions can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, and may also contribute to asthma development in children. For more information. Overview of Companies Defendants in these CAA partial settlements are Volkswagen AG, Audi AG, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., Volkswagen Group of America Chattanooga Operations, LLC, and Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (collectively here “Volkswagen”).

Porsche AG, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Porsche Cars North American, Inc. is the exclusive importer of Porsche vehicles for the United States. The company provides Porsche vehicles, parts, service, marketing and training for its 189 dealers in the United States. Actions to Prevent Future Violations Volkswagen will take various measures to prevent future problems, including among other things the following (some but not all of the following requirements apply to the Porsche defendants). Pursuant to the third partial settlement, Volkswagen will ensure the personnel who test their vehicles for emissions compliance are separate from the personnel who design their vehicles. Volkswagen will also establish a steering committee to ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act. The company will perform portable emission measurement system (PEMS) testing on their vehicles, including gasoline vehicles, and follow strict procedures when developing new vehicles. The company will establish a whistleblower system, and survey employees to gauging compliance, among other things, with United States laws relating to environmental compliance. Lastly, an independent auditor will thoroughly assess Volkswagen’s compliance with this settlement. 3.0 Liter Generation 1 Vehicles In order to achieve the 85 percent recall rate for the 3.0 liter generation 1 vehicles, Volkswagen must offer owners and lessees of these older 3.0 liter vehicles the option to have their vehicle bought back by Volkswagen, or to have their leases terminated at no cost. This buyback or lease termination option will be available to consumers for two years. Additionally, if Volkswagen proposes a generation 1 emissions modification to EPA and CARB and the agencies approve it, Volkswagen must also offer owners and lessees the option of an emissions modification. The EPA and CARB will assess any proposed emissions modification according to detailed requirements that include a substantial reduction in NOx emissions. Any approved emission modification will require extensive testing by Volkswagen and may include both software changes and new hardware. If approved, a generation 1 emissions modification will reduce NOx emissions from the majority of vehicles by approximately 80 percent compared to their original condition. VW must provide consumers with an emissions modification disclosure that has been approved by EPA and CARB and that contains a clear and accurate description regarding all impacts of the emissions modification on the vehicle, including emissions levels as compared with the limits to which the vehicles were originally certified, and any impacts on fuel economy or vehicle maintenance. Any modified vehicle will also be covered by an extended warranty covering the emissions control system. The affected 3.0 liter generation 1 diesel vehicles eligible for a buyback and that may also be eligible for an emissions modification are: - Model year 2009 – 2012 Volkswagen Touareg - Model year 2009 – 2012 Audi Q7 Volkswagen may resell or export vehicles that are bought back or for which the lease is terminated only after performing an EPA and CARB approved emission modification. If there is no approved emissions modification, the vehicles will be recycled or scrapped. Clean Air Act Certification Requirements and Violations The CAA and its regulations aim to protect human health and the environment, in part, by reducing harmful emissions from mobile sources of air pollution. The CAA partial settlements concern light-duty motor vehicles. Light-duty vehicles must satisfy tailpipe emission standards for certain air pollutants, including NOx. Pursuant to the CAA, the EPA administers a certification program to ensure that every vehicle introduced into United States commerce satisfies applicable emission standards. Under this program, manufacturers apply to the EPA for a certificate of conformity (“COC”) and must demonstrate in their applications that representative test vehicles meet emission standards. The EPA issues COCs to vehicle manufacturers based on these applications. A COC covers only those new motor vehicles that conform, in all material respects, to the design specifications described in the manufacturer’s application for that COC. Manufacturers are prohibited from selling any new motor vehicle unless that vehicle is covered by an EPA-issued COC. On January 4, 2016, and as amended on October 7, 2016, the United States filed a complaint against the Volkswagen entities alleging violations of the CAA with regard to approximately 590,000 diesel vehicles sold in the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. complaint alleges that each of these vehicles contains, as part of the engine control module, certain computer algorithms and calibrations that cause the emissions control system of those vehicles to perform differently during normal vehicle operation and use than during emissions testing. The U.S. complaint alleges that these computer algorithms and calibrations are prohibited defeat devices under the CAA, and that during normal vehicle operation and use, the cars emit levels of NOx significantly in excess of the EPA compliant levels.",No claimable amount
183,"D.G. Yuengling and Son, Inc. Clean Water Act Settlement"," (Washington, DC - June 23, 2016)  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice today announced that D. G. Yuengling and Son Inc., has settled Clean Water Act (CWA) violations involving its two large-scale breweries near Pottsville, Pennsylvania. On this page:",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/dg-yuengling-and-son-inc-clean-water-act-settlement,Consent Decree,2016-06-23,"Settlement Resources Consent Decree Overview Violations Injunctive Relief Pollutant Impacts Health and Environmental Effects Civil Penalty Comment Period Contact Injunctive Relief EPA is requiring significant injunctive relief in the consent decree, including environmental audits and multi-facility environmental management system requirements for both of the breweries, construction of a comprehensive biological treatment system at the Old Brewery, and implementation of enhancements to the existing pretreatment system at the New Brewery. The injunctive relief is expected to improve the company’s compliance with the Clean Water Act, resulting in fewer discharges of effluent with permit limit exceedances to rivers and streams. The cost of the required injunctive relief is estimated to be $7 million. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. For More Information, Contact: Douglas Frankenthaler Assistant Regional Counsel U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III 1650 Arch Street Philadelphia, PA 19103-2029 (215) 814-2472​frankenthaler.douglas@epa.gov Civil Penalty The negotiated civil penalty to be paid by defendants is $2.8 million. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits When the required injunctive relief is implemented, the proposed decree will help reduce the risk to the POTW treatment facilities, and thereby reduce the risk of exposure of surrounding communities to pollutants that can significantly impair streams and watersheds. Overview D.G. Yuengling and Son, Inc. (Yuengling) is a Pennsylvania company founded in 1829 as Eagle Brewery. It changed its name to D.G. Yuengling and Son, Inc. in 1873. It is a privately held company in the business of manufacturing and distributing beer and related products. Yuengling primarily sells through distributors in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. It has manufacturing plants/breweries in Pottsville, Pennsylvania and Tampa, Florida. Violations Yuengling owns and operates two beer breweries (the New Brewery and the Old Brewery) in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, which have been in significant non-compliance with the Clean Water Act because of persistent violations of application industrial wastewater discharge permits over the past 10 years. Despite enforcement by the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), which is operated by the Greater Pottsville Area Sanitary Authority (GPASA), and administrative enforcement by EPA, Yuengling had failed to take the steps necessary to comply with its Industrial User (IU) Permits that provide pretreatment requirements for discharges to the POTW. The noncompliance addressed in the proposed consent decree includes numerous discharge limit violations of its IU Permits between 2008 and 2015. It also includes violations involving failures to submit required monitoring reports and comply with monitoring and reporting requirements at both breweries and to take all required samples at both breweries. In total, EPA identified 141 IU permit violations, which are referenced in the complaint and will be resolved by the consent decree. Pollutant Impacts The pollutants at issue in this case include biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), phosphorous, zinc and pH (both high and low). High BOD loadings interfere with the microorganisms in the POTW that neutralize the pollutants, which can significantly impair the POTW’s effectiveness. When wastewater containing BOD and high pH passes through the POTW, it can overload the treatment plant, impacting the ability of the plant to adequately process the waste. Also, high pH can cause damage to the sewer infrastructure, as acidic waste can corrode pipes and other sewer structures, such as pumps.","Zinc concentrations above the discharge limits and the related odor impacts can create negative environmental and public health impacts to surrounding communities.

Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Civil Penalty Trader Joe’s will pay a civil penalty of $500,000 to resolve the alleged claims. Injunctive Relief Under the settlement, Trader Joe’s must implement the following components of injunctive relief and mitigation: First, Trader Joe’s shall implement a refrigerant compliance management plan that provides for better management of refrigerant repairs and leaks. The plan includes several Next Generation Compliance tools such as advanced monitoring and electronic reporting. Second, Trader Joe’s must achieve a company-wide average refrigerant leak rate that is at or below 12.1 percent in calendar years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Third, at all new stores and major remodels, Trader Joe’s must use only refrigerant that is non-ozone depleting and has a low global warming potential (GWP). Finally, at fifteen new stores or major remodels, Trader Joe’s will conduct a pilot research project using advanced, ultra-low-GWP refrigerant such as carbon dioxide (CO2). This settlement helps implement the call in the President’s Climate Action Plan, dated June 2013, to curb emissions of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant as an important step for reducing carbon pollution. This is the first EPA settlement with requirements to repair leaks of HFCs in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly one-quarter of Trader Joe’s refrigerant appliances use HFC refrigerants. The settlement obligations cover equipment using HFC refrigerants that are non-ozone-depleting but have a GWP in the 3,900 to 4,700 range, which means that the specific refrigerants are 3,900 to 4,700 times more potent as GHGs than carbon dioxide over a 100-year time horizon. Trader Joe’s estimates the cost to implement the injunctive relief and mitigation required by this settlement to be $2 million.

Overview of Company Trader Joe’s Company (Trader Joe’s) is a privately held chain of specialty grocery stores in the U.S. which is based in Monrovia, California, in greater Los Angeles. Trader Joe’s owns or operates approximately 461 stores, of which almost 40 percent are in California, with the heaviest concentration in southern California. The company also has locations in 42 other states and Washington, D.C. Violations The United States alleges that Trader Joe’s failed to properly perform leak repair and recordkeeping required under Title VI of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the refrigeration equipment in its grocery stores. Specifically, regulations found at 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart F, Recycling and Emission Reductions require owner and operators of systems using ozone depleting substances (ODSs) to reduce the use and emission of ODSs to their “lowest achievable level” and “maximize the recapture and recycling of such substances.” In addition, the United States alleges that Trader Joe’s failed to provide a complete response to an information request, in violation of Section 114 of the CAA. Pollutant Impacts EPA estimates that this settlement will reduce GHG emissions by approximately 31,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent over three years. This is equivalent to the GHG emissions from over 6,500 passenger vehicles driven in one year, the CO2 from approximately 33.2 million tons of coal burned, or the carbon sequestered by over 25,000 acres of forest.","500,000"
185,Settlement Reached at Salt Creek Park Firing Range Site," On June 13, 2016, a consent decree between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and several state and federal potentially responsible parties (PRPs) was approved by the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In the consent decree, the PRPs agreed to reimburse EPA for over $800,000 of the costs the Agency incurred when it cleaned up lead and other contaminants at the Salt Creek Park Firing Range. The site, which had historically been used by a firing range by both the US military and the Washington National Guard, is now used by local citizens for camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities.

	Contact information",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/case-summary-settlement-reached-salt-creek-park-firing-range-site,Consent Decree,2016-06-13,"Information about the Salt Creek Park Firing Range Site The Salt Creek Park Firing Range site is approximately 1 acre, and is located within Salt Creek Park in Clallam County, Washington, near the town of Port Angeles, Wash. Prior to becoming a park, the Site was used by the military as a firing range during World War II. After military use ended in the late 1950s, there was continued use of the firing range by the Washington National Guard and by a private rifle club. Once all shooting activities ceased on the property, a concerned citizen reported the past use of the property to the Clallam County Health Department. The citizen was concerned about potential lead in soils and the potential risk to people using the area for camping, hiking, and collecting mushrooms. Further investigation led to EPA involvement at the site, and in 2010 EPA conducted a fund-lead time-critical removal action to clean up soils contaminated with heavy metals. The main contaminants of concern addressed by the removal action were lead, copper, nickel, and zinc. In addition to threats of exposure to heavy metals to both human and environmental receptors at the Site, there was also a high risk that hazardous materials would migrate offsite, into nearby surface waters in the Strait of Juan De Fuca. This area encompasses the Lower Elwah Klallam Tribe’s shellfish beds and fishing grounds. More information on the Salt Creek Park Firing Range site is available from the Salt Creek Park on-scene coordinator web page.

The settling parties agreed to pay the following amounts: $165,485.15 by Clallam County; $74,468.32 by the Washington Department of Natural Resources; and $8,274.26 by the Washington National Guard. The United States, on behalf of the settling federal agencies (the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Coast Guard), agreed to pay $579,198.03. The total amount recovered in the consent decree is $827,425.76, which represents 100% of EPA’s past costs at the site. The consent decree was filed with the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and was subject to a 30-day public comment period. The Court approved the consent decree on June 13, 2016. Information about the potentially responsible parties The potentially responsible parties in the cost recovery case were Clallam County, the Washington Department of Natural Resources, and the Washington National Guard (collectively the Settling Defendants), and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and the United States Coast Guard (collectively the Settling Federal Agencies).

186,First Amendment to 2012 U.S. v. Marathon Petroleum Co. Clean Air Act Consent Decree," In April 2012, EPA and the Department of Justice announced an agreement with Marathon Petroleum Company to significantly reduce air pollution from all six petroleum refineries owned by the company at that time. Under the 2012 agreement , Marathon installed state-of-the-art controls on combustion devices known as flares and engaged in innovative practices to reduce waste gases that led to pollution. By the end of 2015, the 2012 agreement resulted in reductions of harmful air pollution by more than 5,200 ton per year. On June 9, 2016, EPA and DOJ announced that Marathon, under an amendment to the 2012 agreement, will spend $319 million to install state-of-the-art Flare Gas Recovery Systems (FGRSs) that will capture and recycle gases that would otherwise be sent to flares at facilities in Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan and Ohio. Marathon will also spend $15.55 million on projects to reduce air pollution at three of the facilities and will pay a civil penalty of $326,500 to the United States. When fully implemented, the amendment is expected to reduce harmful air pollutants by an additional 1,037 tons per year in addition to the reductions achieved under the 2012 consent decree.

Because, however, three FGRSs will start-up on June 30, 2016, and one NOx reduction project already is operating, these temporary emissions increases will be simultaneously more than offset by the emissions reductions from these activities. After December 31, 2018 (when the one-time increase of 52.8 tons of SO2 stops), the seven FGRSs, the enhanced uptime of these seven FGRSs, and the three mitigation projects are projected to result in combined VOC, SO2, and NOx emission reductions of 1,037 tpy. These emission reductions will continue indefinitely on a yearly basis.

189,$6.8 Million Penalty for Violations at Rodale Manufacturing Superfund Site in Pennsylvania," On May 3, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that Schneider Electric USA agreed to pay a $6,868,975 penalty for allegedly violating the terms of a 2002 court-approved Superfund consent decree. The stipulated penalty is the largest in the history of the Superfund program and third largest in the history of the Agency. The violations occurred during cleanup activity at the Rodale Manufacturing Superfund Site in Emmaus, Penn. The violations resulted in uncontrolled emissions of air pollutants that can cause threats to public health and the environment. The violations began at least in 2008 and were resolved by Schneider in 2013 when the company replaced the on-site groundwater treatment system. Schneider Electric is a Fortune Global 500 company and develops connected technologies and solutions to manage energy systems. Previously, the company manufactured ships and armaments.

190,OXY USA Agrees to Settlements Valued at $50 Million for Work at Tennessee Superfund Site," On April 22, 2016, EPA announced settlement agreements valued at approximately $50 million for cleanup work and reimbursement of past cleanup costs at the Copper Basin Mining District Superfund Site in Polk County, Tenn. Under the terms of two concurrent consent decrees, OXY USA agreed to: Spend approximately $40 million to clean up contaminated water and sediments in the Ocoee River and one of its watersheds at the site.
	Reimburse EPA approximately $10.8 million for costs associated with cleanup work at the site. The reimbursement settlement agreement was negotiated with multiple federal agencies, the state of Tennessee, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and OXY USA. One of the main environmental benefits from these two consent decrees is improved water quality of the Ocoee River. Businesses and residents of the local area depend on tourism from its seasonal rafting industry. The remedy will ensure the continued treatment of water from the Davis Mill Creek and maintain the water quality of the Ocoee River. Including the value of the two 2016 consent decrees, and work previously performed at the site, more than $217 million is being devoted to the cleanup of the Copper Basin Mining District Superfund site.

192,EPA Recovers Over $10 million for Cleanup Costs at the Gilt Edge Mine Site," On April 15, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that the Agency and the state of South Dakota reached agreement with Coca Mines, Inc., and Thomas Congdon to settle their respective liabilities at the Gilt Edge Mine Superfund Site by making a payment of just over $10 million. The site encompasses a former open pit and a cyanide heap-leach gold mine, and was used for hard rock mining since the late 1800s. It was extensively disturbed by mining and mineral processing operations. The primary mine operator abandoned the site, leaving mining features such as open pit lakes with high walls of exposed mineralized bedrock, underground mine workings, and acres of waste rock, spent ore, and tailings. Exposure to the sulfide-containing materials to air and oxygen generates approximately 95 million gallons of acid rock drainage every year. The money recovered will help pay for the cleanup, alleviating the taxpayer burden. On this page: Information about the companies

Health and Environment Effects Total suspended solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, effluent or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) – COD is a measure based on the chemical decomposition of organic and inorganic contaminants, dissolved or suspended in water. As with BOD, high levels of COD indicate high levels of pollutants are present in the wastewater that will consume oxygen from the water, and may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients - Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. Overview of Facilities The City of Greenville, MS (City) owns and operates the Greenville Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTP), approximately 200 miles of sanitary sewer lines, and 100 sanitary sewer pump stations and associated appurtenances. The system’s service population is approximately 34,700 persons. Next Generation To increase transparency, the Partial Consent Decree requires the City to post on its website instructions to the public for receiving email notice when Deliverables that are required to be prepared and/or submitted by the City pursuant to the Partial Consent Decree are posted to the City’s website. Violations The complaint seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties and alleges four claims under the CWA and the Mississippi Air and Water Pollution Control Law (MAWPCL) § 49-17-1 et seq. These claims are: (1) unauthorized discharges into navigable waters; (2) failure to comply with NPDES permit conditions for operation and maintenance of its sanitary sewer system, (3) failure to comply with NPDES permit effluent discharge limitations, and (4) failure to comply with NPDES permit conditions regarding timely reporting noncompliance. Climate Change The Partial Consent Decree includes provisions that take into account EPA’s encouragement of practices that improve the resilience of cities’ sewer systems to the impacts of climate change. Specially, the Partial Consent Decree states, “[a]ll Work shall be performed using sound engineering practices to ensure that construction, management, operation and maintenance of the Sewer System complies with the CWA, including practices to improve the resilience of the Sewer System to the impacts of climate change,” and directs the City to utilize EPA’s Climate Ready Water Utilities Initiative and EPA’s Climate Resilience Evaluation and Awareness Tool Version 2.0.",0
196,EPA and Navy Reach Multimillion Dollar Cleanup Agreement for Gorst Creek site," On January 20, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Navy reached a multimillion dollar agreement to remove a landfill located in Gorst Creek south of Bremerton, Wash. The landfill was created in the 1960s when several parties, including the Puget Sound Naval Station disposed of over 150,000 cubic yards of waste material in a deep creek ravine. The waste material impedes the flow of the creek through the ravine, which during heavy precipitation can cause localized flooding that erodes the landfill and sends waste material downstream. The agreement requires the Navy to fund the removal of the landfill and the restoration of the creek ravine and fish habitat at an estimated cost of approximately $30 million. Gorst Creek is habitat for threatened Chinook salmon and steelhead, as well as coastal cutthroat trout, a state priority species. Landfill slides degrade downstream water quality and habitat, and the crushed culvert blocks fish passage to upstream habitat. The Suquamish Tribe operates a Chinook hatchery 2.5 miles downstream and is concerned about impacts on fish and habitat.

During this time, the landfill received auto wrecking wastes, medical waste, and other material from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and demolition debris and municipal solid waste. The volume of waste in the landfill is estimated at over 150,000 cubic yards. In 1968, a pipe was installed in the ravine to contain the creek, which allowed the operators to fill the ravine with waste and debris. The weight of the landfill crushed the creek culvert in at least two locations. The crushed culvert restricts water flow, and when it rains the creek impounds upstream of the landfill, at times reaching depths of 40 to 60 feet. Impounded water seeps through the landfill and occasionally flows over its surface, causing erosion and failure of the landfill slope. The landfill also presents a threat to State Highway 3 located approximately 100 yards downstream. Waste from previous landfill slides has blocked the culvert beneath the highway, requiring the Washington Department of Transportation to clear the culvert to prevent highway flooding and erosion of the highway embankment. Soil, sediment, and water sampling in 1999 and 2004 found arsenic, chromium, PCBs, pesticides and other polluting chemicals at the landfill. This pollution could move further into the environment and pose a risk to people, animals, and the environment. The plan to remove the landfill and restore the creek and habitat will be done in consultation with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Suquamish Tribe, and Washington State Department of Transportation.

The agreement requires the ST Trust to record an environmental covenant that will protect the site and creek ravine in perpetuity. The settlement agreement became effective on January 20, 2016 following a 30-day public comment.

Simplot will comply with both a short-term and a long-term emission rate at each sulfuric acid plant; collectively, the long-term emission rates are some of the lowest rates achieved in any sulfuric acid plant settlement to-date. Simplot will implement improved continuous emissions monitoring systems to ensure compliance with the emission rates and will prepare and implement an operation and maintenance plan for each sulfuric acid plant. In addition, at the #400 Don sulfuric acid plant at the Pocatello facility, Simplot will comply with emission limits for sulfuric acid mist and PM2.5. The settlement also requires compliance with the New Source Performance Standards for sulfuric acid plants under 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subparts A and H. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comment is available at the Department of Justice website. Mitigation Project The Lathrop sulfuric acid plant is located in the San Joaquin Valley, which is currently designated as nonattainment for federal ambient air quality standards (known as NAAQS, or National Ambient Air Quality Standards) for PM2.5. Simplot has agreed to a $200,000 mitigation project that will provide incentives to residents of the San Joaquin Valley to replace older, higher-emitting wood-burning devices with cleaner, lower-emitting hearth options. These wood stove change-outs will reduce emissions of PM2.5, along with emissions of volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and hazardous air pollutants. State and Regional Partners The State of Idaho, on behalf of its Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District joined the United States in this consent decree. Civil Penalty Simplot will pay an $899,000 civil penalty: the United States will receive $732,000; the State of Idaho will receive $167,000. For more information, contact: Daniel Schaufelberger U. S.

SO2 emissions can also react in the atmosphere to form small particles of sulfates. These fine particles (also known as PM2.5) can penetrate deeply into sensitive parts of the lungs and can cause or worsen respiratory disease, such as emphysema and bronchitis, and can aggravate existing heart disease, leading to increased hospital admissions and premature death. Fine particles (PM2.5) are also the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States. SO2 is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain. Since SO2 is a precursor to the formation of PM2.5, the SO2 emissions controls at the Lathrop facility sulfuric acid plant will also offer some benefits in helping the San Joaquin Valley to address the PM2.5 NAAQS nonattainment status. Overview of Company Simplot is a privately held food and agribusiness company. Its main operations include ranching, food processing, mining, retail, and fertilizer production. Its fertilizer production operations include the operation of sulfuric acid production plants. The sulfuric acid plants use elemental sulfur to produce phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is then combined with ammonia to produce the common fertilizer diammonium phosphate. This settlement covers all five of Simplot’s sulfuric acid plants. Pollutant Reductions Once all of the upgraded emissions controls have been implemented, this settlement will result in an estimated 2,540 tons per year reduction of SO2 emissions. In addition, the mitigation project should provide approximately 70 tons per year of additional emission reductions (combined reductions of carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, PM2.5, and hazardous air pollutants). Violations The Complaint alleges that Simplot made modifications to its sulfuric acid plants, resulting in increased emissions of sulfur dioxide, without first obtaining pre-construction permits and installing required pollution control equipment, in violation of: The Clean Air Act (CAA) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permitting requirement provisions, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7470-7492, 7661-7661f. The State Implementation Plans (SIPs) of California, Idaho, and Wyoming, 42 U.S.C. § 7410. The settlement also resolves alleged violations of PSD for emissions of sulfuric acid mist and PM2.5 at one of the sulfuric acid plants located near Pocatello, Idaho (known as the #400 Don sulfuric acid plant), as well as liability for any past violations at the sulfuric acid plants of the CAA New Source Performance Standards, 42 U.S.C. § 7411, and the corresponding regulations for sulfuric acid plants at 40 C.F.R.

Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Environmental Justice The EPA’s environmental justice screening process did not indicate any unique or acute environmental justice concerns because the gasoline that the defendants produced was widely distributed. However, the mitigation projects are located near an area that may present environmental justice concerns. Contact Jeff Kodish OECA/OCE - Air Enforcement Division U.S. EPA 1595 Wynkoop Street (8MSU) Denver, CO 80202-1129 (303) 312-7153kodish.jeff@epa.gov Mitigation The consent decree requires the defendants to take action to mitigate harm to human health and the environment as a result of the excess emissions caused by the violations at issue in this case. Specifically, the defendants will install slotted guide poles on two above ground fuel storage tanks at its Woods Cross Refinery in Woods Cross, Utah. The company will be required to use next generation pollutant detection technology during the implementation of the mitigation projects, and to hire a third-party to verify its compliance status for the mitigation projects. The refinery is located near an area that may present environmental justice concerns. The defendants have also represented to the EPA that they will hire a third-party auditor to evaluate compliance with the fuels regulations at five of their refineries to ensure future compliance. Civil Penalty The defendants will pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million Overview of Companies The HollyFrontier Corporation is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and operates five refineries throughout the mid-continent, southwestern, and Rocky Mountain regions with a cumulative total processing capacity of 443,000 barrels per day. HollyFrontier Refining & Marketing LLC, Frontier El Dorado Refining LLC, Holly Refining & Marketing Company – Woods Cross LLC, and Navajo Refining Company, L.L.C (“defendants”) operate HollyFrontier Corporation’s marketing, crude and product supply, planning, human resources, and accounting functions related to HollyFrontier Corporation’s refineries. Health and Environmental Benefits When inappropriate fuels are used in internal combustion engines, the emissions of pollutants can increase significantly and emission control equipment can be damaged. Notwithstanding improvements in vehicle emission controls, emissions from motor vehicles are a significant portion of all air pollution. The excess emissions that can be linked to the violations at issue in this case are primarily VOCs, including air toxics. Generally, failure to test gasoline according to proper procedures and requirements are considered significant violations, because they result in (1) a reduced ability by the EPA to know whether the fuel at issue met an applicable standard, or would require substantial government resources in order to determine whether the fuel met the applicable standards; (2) a large potential for increased emissions as a result of fuel being used in an inappropriate location, time period, or vehicle type, with consequential increased emissions; and (3) a large negative overall impact on the integrity of the fuels program. The environmental mitigation projects required by the consent decree are estimated to reduce VOC emissions, including air toxics, by about 96 tons of VOCs over the lifetime of the consent decree. Since the projects likely will remain operational after the consent decree is terminated, environmental benefits accruing as a result of these projects are anticipated to continue for many years. Violations The settlement resolves an EPA enforcement action against the defendants for Clean Air Act violations involving their failure to comply with the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) fuel standards at several of their refineries, and their failure to comply with various fuel testing requirements at several of their refineries. The EPA discovered the alleged violations from information self-disclosed by the defendants. The fuel quality violations involve the defendants’ failure to meet RVP standards for gasoline produced at the Woods Cross (Utah), El Dorado (Kansas), and Navajo (New Mexico) refineries at various times from 2006 to 2011. Pollutant Impacts The defendants estimate that their standard violations resulted in about 10 excess tons of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including air toxics. Air toxics – also known as “hazardous air pollutants,” or HAPs – are those pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health or environmental effects. VOCs are one of the primary constituents of smog, which react in sunlight to form low-level ozone. Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion, and can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.","1,200,000"
203,ASARCO LLC Settlement," (Washington, DC – November 3, 2015) Today, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a settlement with ASARCO requiring the company to spend $150 million to install new equipment and pollution control technology to reduce emissions of toxic heavy metals at a large smelter located in Hayden, Ariz.

Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Contacts Virginia Sorrell Air Enforcement Division Office of Civil Enforcement U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Phone: 303-312-6669sorrell.virginia@epa.gov Ivan Lieben Attorney-Advisor USEPA Region 9 75 Hawthorne Street Mail Code: ORC-2-2 San Francisco, CA 94105 (415) 972-3914lieben.ivan@epa.gov Mitigation Projects ASARCO will spend no less than $8 million on the following projects: 1) lead-based paint abatement in the adjacent towns of Hayden and Winkelman; and 2) paving of unpaved county roads that generates fugitive dust emissions close to the towns. The lead-based paint abatement project will provide funds for lead-based paint testing and abatement for homes, schools, and other public buildings in Hayden and Winkelman, Arizona. Lead is one of the two primary HAPs emitted from the smelter, so reducing potential community exposure from lead paint will mitigate lead exposure from the smelter. The road paving project will allow for paving of unpaved roads that are closest to the communities of Hayden and Winkelman to reduce exposure to fugitive PM emissions in those communities. This will also include reductions in HAPs, like arsenic, that are contained in low levels in the local soil. Civil Penalty ASARCO will pay a $4.5 million civil penalty Injunctive Relief The settlement requires the following actions to resolve the Clean Air Act violations: ASARCO will meet requirements for operation of gas capture systems at all process furnaces, including installation of upgraded primary and secondary hooding systems for control of emissions from the copper converter furnaces and installation of a tertiary hooding system. Further, ASARCO will replace the existing copper converter furnaces with furnaces sized to allow production at current capacity with only one converter furnace blowing at any given time such that all gas collected in the primary hooding system and all gas collected by the secondary hoods during blowing operations will be sent to the existing acid plant at the facility to improve control of both particulate matter (PM) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. ASARCO will install long-path optical density/opacity monitors on the outside of the buildings housing the copper converter department, the building housing ore crushing operations, and the fine ore storage building to monitor for fugitive emissions that may be escaping openings on these structures and initiate investigation and corrective actions if emissions are detected. ASARCO will meet PM emission limits set forth in Subpart QQQ for various process emissions, and will also install and operate PM continuous emissions monitoring systems on five gas streams. These systems will give a real-time indication of compliance with the PM emission limits, as opposed to annual snapshots through stack testing requirements. Additionally, ASARCO will comply with a total PM emission limit from the entire process from drying copper concentrate in dryers through the anode casting department, inclusive of those end point steps. This limit is a variation of the limit for new construction area source copper smelters that is set forth in Part 63, Subpart EEEEEE and reflects performance levels anticipated in that rulemaking to be reflective of a well-controlled, greenfield source. ASARCO will use the data from the PM monitoring systems to comply with this limit, along with estimates of fugitive emissions from various process steps as determined by two fugitive emissions studies to be conducted by third parties. ASARCO will replace an existing R&R Cottrell electrostatic precipitator with a new baghouse designed to achieve improved PM control for the emissions routed to that control device. ASARCO will operate baghouse leak detection systems and maintain a minimum inventory of replacement bags at all times to ensure timely response to alarms from those systems. Additionally, for venturi wet scrubbers used to control PM emissions at the facility, ASARCO will install continuous monitoring devices for gas pressure and liquid flow rate and transmit those values to an electronic data storage system that has an associated alarm system if those values fall outside of ranges established for those parameters during performance testing. ASARCO will develop a fugitive dust plan that includes the following controls for fugitive emissions sources at the facility: installation of wind fences, installation of concrete pads to help control loose materials, installation of a new enclosed system for drying of acid plant scrubber blowdown solids, paving of a main road with significant truck traffic, upgrades to water sprayer systems, relocation of revert crushing operations away from a proximate high school, and tarping of materials stored in trains and trucks. Further, ASARCO shall employ a third party to conduct an audit of fugitive dust controls at the facility to identify and recommend possible improvements. ASARCO will maintain five ambient air monitors in proximity to the facility to continue current monitoring for PM10, PM2.5, lead, arsenic, and cadmium ambient concentration levels and undertake an investigation and corrective actions if trigger levels established in the consent decree are exceeded. In addition to requirements targeted to reduce HAP and PM emissions, the settlement includes requirements relating to SO2 emissions controls because of the replacement of the existing copper converter furnaces with new copper converter furnaces. New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) Subpart P includes performance standards for SO2 emissions from new copper converters. The settlement includes the Subpart P compliance obligations. Further, the settlement secures additional SO2 emissions reductions by requiring use of high-surface-area hydrated lime injection to meet a fifty percent control efficiency for SO2 emissions routed to the secondary baghouse and the new R&R Cottrell electrostatic precipitator replacement baghouse. At a 50 percent control efficiency, lime injection is expected to result in an additional 1,200 tpy of SO2 emission reductions. Overview of Company ASARCO is a fully integrated miner, smelter, and refiner of copper in the United States. ASARCO’s operations include three copper mines in Arizona that produce a combined 350 to 400 million pounds of copper per year, a primary copper smelter in Arizona, and a copper refinery in Texas, along with cathode copper production operations co-located with two of the Arizona mines. The primary copper smelter in Hayden, Arizona is the facility at issue in this settlement. Operations at the Hayden smelter take shipments of ore, which is then processed through grinding and milling into a fine powder that is concentrated through a flotation process into a material called copper concentrate, which is about 28 percent copper. Copper concentrate is stored in outdoor piles and then combined with other materials in the bedding operations, which are basically long trenches of fine grained sand or powder-like material. The bedded material is then fed into a flash furnace, in which it ignites with oxygen to burn off large quantities of sulfur and other impurities. The copper-rich material exiting the flash furnace is called copper matte, and it is transferred by ladles to copper converter furnaces. The converter furnaces blow air, or oxygen-enriched air, through the material to burn away iron impurities and any remaining sulfur. The material exiting a converter furnace is transferred in batches to an anode furnace, which blows natural gas into the material to burn off oxygen. The final material is then cast into anodes and shipped offsite to a facility for further refining by passing an electric current through a liquid (electrolysis). The facility produces approximately 300 million pounds of copper anodes per year. Each furnace has a ventilation hood to capture gases leaving the furnace, but some gas still escapes as fugitive emissions, and the control devices do not remove 100 percent of the hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) routed to them. This settlement will improve the capture and control of HAP emissions from the furnaces and reduce fugitive HAP emissions from dust sources at the facility, such as outdoor piles of copper concentrate. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits HAPs, also known as toxic air pollutants, are those pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. This means that people exposed to toxic air pollutants at sufficient concentrations and durations may have an increased chance of getting cancer or experiencing other serious health effects, such as damage to the immune system or neurological, reproductive, developmental, or respiratory problems. Long-term inhalation exposure to inorganic arsenic is associated with irritation of the skin and mucous membranes and effects in the brain and nervous system and has been strongly associated with lung cancer. Exposure to lead (inhalation or oral) can cause effects on the blood, as well as the nervous, immune, renal, and cardiovascular systems, and early childhood and prenatal exposures are associated with slowed cognitive development, learning deficits, and other effects. Particle pollution, especially inhalable coarse particles (PM10) and fine particles (PM2.5), can cause coughing or difficulty breathing, decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, and even premature death in people with heart or lung disease. SO2 has also been linked to a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system, and SO2 is also a precursor to the formation of PM2.5. Fine particles are also the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States, including national parks and wilderness areas. The PM2.5 and SO2 emission reductions achieved through compliance with this settlement will also serve to reduce visibility impairment owing to emissions from the facility. Violations The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to periodically publish a list of all categories and subcategories of major sources and area sources of air pollutants that have been listed as HAPs; the EPA is then required to establish emissions standards for each such category and subcategory. Primary copper smelters have been listed as a category of major sources of HAPs, and the emissions standards for such facilities are found at Part 63, Subpart QQQ. Section 112(a)(1) defines a “major source” as “any stationary source…that emits or has the potential to emit considering controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants.” An inspection conducted by the EPA’s National Enforcement Investigations Center concluded that the facility is a major source of HAPs because it has a potential to emit greater than 10 tons per year (tpy) of both arsenic and lead individually, and a potential to emit of greater than 25 tpy of total HAPs. However, ASARCO has claimed minor source status since Subpart QQQ was promulgated, and the facility has therefore failed to comply with Subpart QQQ since the rule’s effective date of June 13, 2005. This settlement will bring ASARCO into compliance with the requirements of Subpart QQQ and resolve alleged noncompliance with Subpart QQQ at the Hayden smelter, as well as provide a release for ASARCO’s failure to include those requirements in its air permit required under title V of the Clean Air Act. Pollutant Impacts The Hayden area of Gila and Pinal Counties is currently classified as nonattainment for the 2008 lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and the 1-hour primary SO2 NAAQS. Since the facility is the only source of lead and SO2 emissions in the Hayden nonattainment area, emission reductions must come from the smelter to allow for attainment of the NAAQS. While compliance with this settlement will result in SO2 emissions decreases from approximately 21,400 tpy to approximately 2,000 tpy, modeling performed by ASARCO’s consultants indicates that all but approximately 1,200 tpy of that reduction would be required to achieve compliance with the NAAQS. Emissions reductions from this settlement will help address both the Hayden-area’s lead and SO2 NAAQS nonattainment status, as well as reduce community exposure to arsenic and other HAPs, and PM, PM10, and PM2.5 generally. The EPA estimates that the settlement will reduce emissions by no less than approximately 3,500 tons per year of PM and 8.5 tons per year of HAPs. Supplemental Environmental Project ASARCO will replace one existing diesel switch locomotive operated at the facility with a diesel-electric switch locomotive controlled to Tier 3 or better emissions standards at a cost of approximately $1 million. This project will result in reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and, owing to the use of diesel-electric engines that will result in reduced fuel consumption, greenhouse gases. Further, because NOx is a precursor to PM2.5, this project will result in reduced PM2.5 in the vicinity.",$4.5 million

Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW (MC 2243A) Washington, DC 20460 (202) 564-8329bruce.susan@epa.gov Civil Penalty RIDOT will pay a civil penalty of $315,000 and preserve two properties as a supplemental environmental project. The parcels will be preserved in their natural state in perpetuity, providing environmental protection to a portion of the watersheds in Johnston and Lincoln, Rhode Island. Health and Environmental Effects Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through MS4s and ultimately discharged untreated into local rivers, lakes and streams. Roads and highways discharge metals, phosphorous, nitrogen, sediment and suspended particles, grease, and salt. Urban roadways also discharge trash and significant amounts of bacteria. Illicit discharges can enter the MS4 through direct connections (e.g., wastewater piping either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the MS4) or indirect connections (e.g., infiltration into the MS4, spills collected by storm drains, or paint or used oil dumped directly into a storm drain). The result is untreated discharges that contribute high levels of pollutants, including heavy metals, toxics, oil and grease, solvents, nutrients, viruses, and bacteria to receiving waters. When discharged into nearby waterways through MS4s, these pollutants can degrade water quality, thereby discouraging recreational uses, contaminating drinking water supplies, and adversely impacting fish, other aquatic life and wildlife. In addition, an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces (e.g., parking lots, driveways, and rooftops) resulting from new development can impact waterbodies by increasing the quantity and velocity of water delivered to the waterbodies during storms. This can result in streambank scouring and erosion and downstream flooding which can harm aquatic life and damage property. The stormwater NPDES permit program requires municipalities to develop and implement a stormwater management program that is intended to improve the quality of local waterways by reducing the impact of new development and reducing the amount of pollutants that stormwater runoff and melting snow pick up and carry into storm sewer systems. Overview of Storm Sewer Authority The Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) operates a Phase II municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) that serves RIDOT roadways and facilities across the State of Rhode Island. The RIDOT MS4 is an expansive system, with more than 25,000 catch basins and 3,800 outfalls that extend over 3,300 lane miles, approximately one-third of which are divided highways, the rest are rural and urban surface roads; about one-half of the system is within the MS4 Permit Area. RIDOT is authorized under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit to discharge stormwater to waters of the United States through its MS4 provided it complies with all provisions of the permit.

Bruce Water Enforcement Division U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW (MC 2243A) Washington, DC 20460 (202) 564-8329bruce.susan@epa.gov Health and Environmental Effects Polluted stormwater runoff is commonly transported through MS4s and ultimately discharged untreated into local rivers, lakes and streams. Common pollutants discharged through MS4s include road salt, sand, oil and grease from roadways; pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides from lawns and parks; sediment from construction sites; and carelessly discarded trash, such as cigarette butts, paper wrappers, and plastic bottles. In addition, municipalities conduct numerous activities that can pose a threat to water quality if practices and procedures are not in place to prevent pollutants from entering the MS4. These activities include winter road maintenance, minor road repairs and other infrastructure work, automobile fleet maintenance, landscaping and park maintenance, and building maintenance. Discharges from MS4s also often include contaminated stormwater runoff from industrial facilities as well as illicit discharges of wastes and wastewater from non-stormwater sources. Illicit discharges can enter the MS4 through direct connections (e.g., wastewater piping either mistakenly or deliberately connected to the MS4) or indirect connections (e.g., infiltration into the MS4, spills collected by storm drains, or paint or used oil dumped directly into a storm drain). The result is untreated discharges that contribute high levels of pollutants, including heavy metals, toxics, oil and grease, solvents, nutrients, viruses, and bacteria to receiving waters. When discharged into nearby waterways through MS4s, these pollutants can degrade water quality, thereby discouraging recreational uses, contaminating drinking water supplies, and adversely impacting fish, other aquatic life and wildlife. In addition, an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces (e.g., parking lots, driveways, and rooftops) resulting from new development can impact waterbodies by increasing the quantity and velocity of water delivered to the waterbodies during storms. This can result in streambank scouring and erosion and downstream flooding which can harm aquatic life and damage property. The stormwater NPDES permit program requires municipalities to develop and implement a stormwater management program that is intended to improve the quality of local waterways by reducing the impact of new development and reducing the amount of pollutants that stormwater runoff and melting snow pick up and carry into storm sewer systems. Overview of Company The City of Rockford, Illinois owns and operates a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). The city is authorized under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to discharge stormwater to waters of the United States through its MS4 provided it complies with all provisions of the permit. Violations The city failed to develop and implement a stormwater pollution prevention and management program that minimizes the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable in violation of Section 402 of the Clean Water Act and the terms and conditions of its NPDES permit. Specific deficiencies include: Failure to adequately inspect and maintain city-owned stormwater structural controls such as detention basins; Failure to develop and implement an industrial and high risk runoff program, e.g., the city did not develop a complete inventory of industrial and high risk facilities and did not inspect facilities for compliance with the city’s stormwater ordinances; Failure to implement an adequate construction program, e.g., the city did not conduct adequate review of erosion and sediment control plans or implement an adequate inspection program; Failure to develop and implement an adequate illicit discharge identification and elimination program, e.g., the city did not conduct dry weather screening to identify illicit discharges; Failure to conduct and document feasibility studies for retrofitting the city’s flood control devices to provide additional pollutant removal; Failure to conduct a wet weather screening program that complies with permit requirements; and Failure to provide adequate finances, staff, equipment and support capabilities to implement its stormwater program.",329395
207,"Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC Settlement"," (Washington, DC – October 1, 2015)  EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice announced a settlement with Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC that will ensure the proper treatment, storage, and disposal of an estimated 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste at six Mosaic facilities in Florida and two in Louisiana. The settlement resolves a series of alleged violations by Mosaic, one of the world’s largest fertilizer manufacturers, of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which provides universal guidelines for how hazardous waste must be stored, handled and disposed. The 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste addressed in this case is the largest amount ever covered by a federal or state RCRA settlement and will ensure that wastewater at Mosaic’s facilities is properly managed and does not pose a threat to groundwater resources. The 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste is based on the combined amount of corrosive wastewaters that will be treated at terminal closure of the facilities. Mosaic is one of the fertilizers industry’s best performers in its ability to reduce large volumes of corrosive wastewater in its phosphogypsum stack systems. In addition to recovering valuable phosphate and other compounds, Mosaic is able to reduce terminal closure costs while ensuring that its phosphogypsum stack systems are operated in an environmentally safe manner. Four Mosaic facilities (New Wales, Bartow, Riverview in Florida and Uncle Sam in Louisiana) will continue to produce phosphoric acid and actively utilize its phosphogypsum stack systems. Mosaic is in the closure process for the Green Bay Complex and South Pierce facility in Florida, and the Faustina facility in Louisiana. However, Faustina will continue to manufacture ammoniated fertilizer. Mosaic operated a small sulfuric acid plant at the Mulberry facility in Florida for a short time. The Mulberry sulfuric acid plant was closed around 2008 and there are no obligations regarding this site in this settlement. Mosaic has been making major improvements at all its facilities and completed several notable projects: installation of state-of-the-art elementary neutralization units to improve the management of sulfuric acid waste streams, upgrading air scrubbers at its granulation and phosphoric acid plants, and installing automated spill and leak detection systems. All of these projects have been closely monitored by Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and Louisiana Department of Environmental Protection, who provided valuable expertise at each step of the process.

Civil Penalty Mosaic will also pay a $5 million civil penalty to the United States and $1.55 million to the State of Louisiana and $1.45 million to the State of Florida, who joined EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice as plaintiffs in this case and who will assist EPA in implementing the terms of the settlement. Injunctive Relief Mosaic will prevent the release of hazardous, or highly-corrosive, wastewaters from fertilizer production to the phosphogypsum stack system through an innovative reconfiguration of current operations. The development of these of industry-leading technologies will better optimize natural resource efficiency and decrease the amount of raw materials required to produce fertilizer. Mosaic will significantly reduce the amount of ammonia going to the phosphogypsum stack system by reconfiguring secondary scrubbers to cease circulation of ammonia-laden corrosive wastewater back to the phosphogypsum stack system. Mosaic will implement a best management practices plan to address potential leaks and spills of phosphoric acid from phosphoric acid and granulation operations. Mosaic will continue to install advanced engineering controls that will mitigate future impacts from its phosphogypsum stack systems. Mosaic has agreed to comprehensive financial assurance provisions, including a $630 million dedicated trust fund, as well as a $50 million letter of credit and a corporate guarantee by its parent company, The Mosaic Company, to ensure funds are available for its estimated cost of $1.8 billion for closure and long-term care of its phosphogypsum stack systems in Florida and Louisiana. Mosaic has additionally agreed to provide a corporate guarantee from its parent company for $8 million in annual coverage for accidental occurrences that cause property damage or bodily injury to third parties. Mosaic has agreed to implement an estimated $1.2 million environmental project in Florida to mitigate and prevent certain potential environmental impacts associated with an orphaned industrial property located in Mulberry, Florida. Mosaic has agreed to fund $1 million in environmental studies in Louisiana, including studies regarding Louisiana statewide water quality criteria/standards for minerals and the development of Louisiana producer-specific watershed nutrient management plans to be utilized by beef cattle, dairy, and poultry producers. Overview of Company Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, a subsidiary of The Mosaic Company in Plymouth, Minnesota is one of the largest producers of fertilizer and phosphate products in the world with 11.7 million tons of operational capacity. Mosaic’s Florida and Louisiana operations employ nearly 4,400 employees and 3,500 contractors. The facilities covered by this settlement are located in Florida and Louisiana and include fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Bartow, Riverview, New Wales, Green Bay, South Pierce, and Mulberry in Florida and Uncle Sam and Faustina in Louisiana. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Reduced risk of release of billions of gallons of hazardous wastewaters Reduce the potential for groundwater impacts and surface water impacts and can contaminate drinking water and cause fish kills. In a national enforcement effort, EPA has focused on compliance in the phosphoric acid industry because of the high risk of releases of acidic wastewaters at these facilities. Examples of effects include: A 2007 release at the Agrifos phosphoric acid facility in Houston caused 50 million gallons of hazardous wastewaters to be released into the Houston Ship Channel. A 2009 sinkhole at the PCS White Springs phosphoric acid facility in north Florida released over 90 million gallons of hazardous wastewaters into the Floridian aquifer, the drinking water source for Florida and south Georgia. Violations Mosaic produces phosphorus-based fertilizer that is commonly applied to corn, wheat and other crops across the country. Sulfuric acid is used to extract phosphorus from mined rock, which produces large quantities of a solid material called phosphogypsum and wastewater that contains high levels of acid. EPA inspections revealed that Mosaic was mixing certain types of highly-corrosive substances from its fertilizer operations, which qualify as hazardous waste, with the phosphogypsum and wastewater from mineral processing, which is a violation of federal and state hazardous waste laws. EPA inspected Mosaic’s phosphate production facilities in Florida and Louisiana and alleged the following violations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA): Failure to make hazardous waste determinations for scrubber effluents, fluorosilicic acid-production wastes, product spills and leaks, and wastes from cleaning pipes and tanks (40 C.F.R. § 262.11); Treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes without a permit or interim status (42 U.S.C. § 6925(a) and 40 C.F.R. Part 264, Subparts A-G, K, and CC); Failure to perform land disposal determinations and to meet land disposal restrictions for hazardous wastes (40 C.F.R. Part 268); Failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure, long-term care, and third-party liability (40 C.F.R. Part 264 Subpart H); and Failure to comply with recordkeeping requirements (40 C.F.R. § 262.40).",$7 million

Civil Penalty The respondents will pay a total civil penalty of $775,000. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Recreational vehicles emit carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides that contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone. Nitrogen Oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause or contribute to a variety of health problems and adverse environmental impacts, such as ground-level ozone, acid rain, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Affected populations include children and people with lung diseases such as asthma. Exposure to these conditions can cause damage to lung tissue for people who work or exercise outside. Ground-level ozone – Ground-level ozone is formed by reactions involving hydrocarbons and NOx in the presence of sunlight. Breathing ozone can trigger a variety of health problems, including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion. It also can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ground-level ozone damages vegetation and ecosystems as well. In the United States, ozone is responsible for an estimated $500 million in reduced crop production each year. Carbon monoxide – Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is formed when carbon in fuel is not burned completely. It is a component of motor vehicle exhaust, which contributes about 56 percent of all carbon monoxide emissions nationwide. Carbon monoxide can cause harmful health effects by reducing oxygen delivery to the body's organs (like the heart and brain) and tissues. Violations The settlement resolves violations of CAA Title II and 40 CFR Parts 86, 90, 1051 and 1068, concerning the importation and sale of about 28,000 uncertified all-terrain vehicles, off-highway motorcycles, and engines that varied from the certificates of conformity that the company submitted to EPA. The illegal vehicles had adjustable carburetors that were not described in their application for certification, were produced by a different manufacturer than the one specified in the application, were manufactured prior to the date of the certificate of conformity, had model names that were not identified on the certificate of conformity, or were significantly more powerful than described. The illegal engines were incorrectly certified as non-road engines rather than as recreational vehicles and some were significantly more powerful than described in the allegedly applicable certificate of conformity. The EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice also alleged that the emission control information labels on certain vehicles did not comply with federal regulations, and that Tractor Supply Company provided an incomplete and inaccurate response to EPA’s information request. Pollutant Impacts EPA estimates that the illegal vehicles and engines already sold by Tractor Supply Company have contributed to excess emissions of 23.5 tons of excess hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions and 12.2 tons of excess carbon monoxide emissions.","775,000"

The Town is authorized under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to discharge stormwater to waters of the United States through its MS4 provided it complies with all provisions of the permit. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Sewage discharged through the Town’s MS4 contains various pollutants, including bacteria and other pathogens, and threatens public health and the environment. Swampscott’s discharges from its MS4 outfalls have persistently exceeded the Massachusetts Water Quality Standards for fecal coliform, E. Coli, and/or Enterococcus bacteria. Other pollutants of concern include: Total suspended solids (TSS) – TSS indicates the measure of suspended solids in wastewater, stormwater runoff, or water bodies. High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Nutrients – Excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in waters can produce harmful algal blooms. These blooms contribute to the creation of hypoxia or “dead zones” in water bodies where dissolved oxygen levels are so low that most aquatic life cannot survive. Pollutant Reductions Implementation of the Consent Decree will result in the following estimated annual pollutant reductions: 365 pounds of total suspended solids; 349 pounds of biological oxygen demand; 57 pounds of Total Nitrogen; and 8 pounds of Total Phosphorous. Violations The Town violated Section 301 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the terms and conditions of its NPDES permit. The violations include the discharge of untreated wastewater containing pollutants, including sewage, from the Town’s MS4 outfalls into Nahant Bay and Massachusetts Bay. The Town’s violations of its NPDES permit include its failure to implement control measures required by the permit to minimize the discharge of pollutants from the MS4 included the following: Failure to effectively prohibit, through an ordinance or other regulatory mechanism, non-storm water discharges into the system; Failure to develop and implement a program to identify and eliminate illicit connections and discharges to the MS4, including discharges of sewage; Failure to adopt an ordinance or other regulatory mechanism to require sediment and erosion control at construction sites; and, Failure to adopt an ordinance or other regulatory mechanism to address post- construction stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment sites.",65000

231,"Noble Energy, Inc. Settlement"," (Washington, DC - April 22, 2015) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Justice, and the State of Colorado announced a settlement with Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) that comprehensively identifies and addresses issues with vapor control systems at Noble’s condensate storage tank batteries in the Denver-area 8-hour ozone marginal nonattainment area (nonattainment area). On this page:",https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/noble-energy-inc-settlement,Consent Decree,2015-04-22,"Settlement Resources Press Release Consent Decree Overview of Company and Operations Violations Injunctive Relief Mitigation Projects Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) Pollutant Impacts Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Civil Penalty Comment Period Contact Injunctive Relief The settlement requires the following actions to resolve the Clean Air Act violations: Noble will perform engineering evaluations addressing certain identified minimum considerations to ensure its vapor control systems are properly designed and sized to control VOC emissions. Following the engineering evaluations, Noble must make any necessary modifications to ensure each vapor control system is properly designed and sized, perform infrared camera inspections to ensure that the vapor control systems are controlling emissions and the tanks are not emitting VOCs, and then implement a directed inspection and preventative maintenance program to ensure proper upkeep and operation of the systems. A third-party auditor will review Noble’s engineering evaluations of the vapor control systems at all tank systems and perform infrared camera inspections at a cross-section of the tank systems. Noble will evaluate the condition of pressure relief valves, thief hatches, and mountings and gaskets on each condensate storage tank and address any evidence of VOC emissions from those devices. Noble will install Next Generation pressure monitors with continuous data reporting on a cross-section of the tank systems to verify that storage tanks are not experiencing increased pressure readings indicative of tank over-pressurization that could cause VOC emissions. Noble will prepare and publicly post reports containing useful information on its vapor control system engineering evaluations and modifications, intended to provide other companies with the opportunity to learn from Noble’s findings and apply them to their own storage tanks, helping to reduce emissions. It is estimated that implementation of these actions will cost approximately $60 million and reduce VOC emissions by over 2,400 tons per year in the nonattainment area. Comment Period The proposed settlement, lodged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval. Information on submitting comments is available at the Department of Justice website. Mitigation Projects Noble will spend at least $4.5 million on the following environmental mitigation projects that will reduce ozone precursor emissions – VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – by an estimated combined total of 800 or more tons per year: Loading condensate from storage tanks into tanker trucks in a closed system consisting of pipes and hoses designed to prevent vapors from being emitted to the atmosphere; Drill rig diesel engine retrofits to reduce emissions of NOx and/or other ozone precursors; Fracturing equipment – pressure pump – diesel engine retrofits to reduce emissions of NOx and/or other ozone precursors; and Changeout of gas lawn mowers for electric mowers to reduce VOC emissions during the summer ozone season. Noble will also require its tank truck contractors to implement an alternative oil measurement standard for product loadout if and when the American Petroleum Institute approves of the alternate method and relevant regulatory authorities adopt or endorse that method. This alternative standard would reduce or eliminate thief hatch opening during the sampling process for tank truck loadout and further reduce VOC emissions by an estimated 250 tons per year. Civil Penalty Noble will pay a $4.95 million civil penalty divided as follows: $3.475 million to the United States; and $1.475 million to Colorado. For More Information, Contact: Virginia Sorrell U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (ENF-L) 1595 Wynkoop St. Denver, CO 80202 (303) 312-6669sorrell.virginia@epa.gov Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) Noble will spend no less than $1 million on a federally-approved wood stove changeout SEP in the nonattainment area. This project will reduce emissions of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), VOCs, and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from woodstove appliances in the nonattainment area. Noble will spend no less than $1 million on a federally-approved SEP aimed at improving the reliability of hydrocarbon liquids sampling and analysis procedures, which can be used to estimate emissions and properly size condensate storage tanks’ vapor control systems. By identifying techniques that eliminate potential sources of error, the study should facilitate more accurate and reliable sampling results that provide better emission estimates for properly engineering and sizing vapor control systems. This SEP is likely to lead to future emission reductions. Noble will spend $2 million on additional State-approved SEPs. Noble will propose projects for State approval after the court concludes its review of the settlement. Overview of Company and Operations Noble Energy, Inc. is an oil and natural gas exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas. Noble has extensive domestic and international oil and natural gas assets and production activities. Noble’s U.S. onshore assets include operations in Colorado’s Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Noble’s operations in the Denver-Julesburg Basin are located both inside and outside of the nonattainment area. Noble’s Denver-Julesburg Basin operations include oil and gas wells, condensate storage tanks, and vapor control systems. A condensate storage tank collects liquid hydrocarbons that have been separated from natural gas after production from an oil and gas well. The liquid hydrocarbons, or condensate, are stored in tanks – multiple tanks located together constitute a tank battery – until pickup and transfer for sale and transport in a tank truck. Vapor control systems are required at many tank batteries to capture and recover or combust the condensate’s hydrocarbon vapors. Multiple tank batteries can be served by the same vapor control system. Improperly or inadequately designed, sized, operated, or maintained vapor control systems can lead to uncontrolled emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and may contain hazardous air pollutants such as benzene. This settlement covers more than 3,400 tank batteries that are connected to approximately 2,400 vapor control systems, which represent essentially all of Noble’s vapor control systems in the nonattainment area operating pursuant to Colorado State Implementation Plan requirements. As defined in this settlement, a “tank system” refers to all of the tank batteries connected to a single vapor control system. Health Effects and Environmental Benefits Ground-level ozone and PM2.5 cause a wide variety of health and environmental impacts. Ground-level ozone can cause temporary breathing difficulty for people with asthma, airway inflammation, and even permanent scarring of lung tissue from repeated exposure. PM2.5 has been linked to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, aggravated asthma, and increased coughing or difficulty breathing. Additionally, fine particles (PM2.5) are the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States, including many of our national parks and wilderness areas. This settlement’s emissions reductions will help address the Denver-area’s ozone marginal nonattainment status generally, as well as the visible buildup of air pollution during inversion conditions. Violations The settlement resolves past violations of Colorado’s Regulation 7, Section XII requirements for controlling VOC emissions from oil and gas operations. The 2008 version of the Section XII requirements is part of Colorado’s federally-approved State Implementation Plan. Federally-approved State Implementation Plan requirements are federally enforceable under the Clean Air Act. Specifically, the settlement resolves alleged past violations of Regulation 7, Section XII requirements relating to installation, operation, maintenance, design, and sizing of vapor control systems at condensate storage tanks. The settlement also resolves past liability for (i) system-wide emissions reduction requirements under Section XII and (ii) failures to mark identification numbers on storage tanks and combustors. Pollutant Impacts Ozone is not emitted directly from air pollution sources. Instead, it is a photochemical oxidant formed when certain chemicals – VOCs and NOx – in the ambient air react with oxygen in the presence of sunlight. VOCs and NOx are called “ozone precursors.” Sources that emit ozone precursors are regulated to reduce ground-level ozone in the ambient air. The Denver-area is currently classified as marginal nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The nonattainment area spans Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and parts of Larimer and Weld counties. The Denver-area’s location next to the Rocky Mountains makes it prone to temperature inversions, in which warm air traps cooler air near the ground such that pollutants do not rise into the atmosphere. These inversion conditions can lead to an unhealthy – and even visible – air pollution buildup. Noble’s oil and gas exploration and production operations in the Denver-Julesburg Basin emit VOCs, NOx, and other pollutants. As a result of the settlement’s injunctive relief, mitigation projects, and SEPs, the following emissions reductions will be achieved: VOCs: Greater than 3,270 tons per year; CO: An estimated 450 tons per year; NOx: An estimated 60 tons per year; PM2.5: An estimated 60 tons per year; and HAPs: An estimated 10 tons per year.",49.95

The active ingredient is aminocyclopyrachlor (CASRN 858956-35-1). Starting in June 2011, EPA began receiving complaints from state pesticide agencies regarding evergreen damage related to the use of Imprelis. To date, DuPont has submitted over 7,000 adverse incident reports involving damage (including death) to non-target trees – primarily Norway spruce and white pine – related to the application of Imprelis. Test data from DuPont has confirmed certain coniferous trees, including Norway spruce and balsam fir, as susceptible to being damaged or killed by the application of Imprelis. In August 2011, EPA issued a Stop Sale, Use or Removal Order to DuPont, prohibiting the distribution, sale, movement or removal of Imprelis products under the ownership, control, or custody of DuPont without EPA’s written approval. In September 2011, EPA, with consent from DuPont, amended the registration of Imprelis to, among other things, prohibit the sale, distribution or marketing of Imprelis absent action by EPA. The registration expired on September 8, 2014. For more information, contact Tom Charlton, Attorney Waste and Chemical Enforcement Division Office of Civil Enforcement U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (202) 564-6960charlton.tom@epa.gov Environmental Effects DuPont’s Imprelis Herbicide was conditionally registered for use to control broadleaf weeds, such as dandelions, clover, thistle, plantains, and ground ivy, and was marketed by DuPont for lawn and turf applications on residential and commercial lawns, golf courses, sod farms, schools, parks, and athletic fields. EPA has received reports of severe damage to evergreens (especially Norway spruce and white pine) and other desirable trees related to the use of Imprelis starting in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. It was reported in several newspapers that DuPont received over 30,000 claims for compensation by homeowners, landscapers, golf courses, and other affected entities with crop damage from the use of Imprelis. In 2013, Dupont reached a settlement with representative plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit in federal court in Pennsylvania. Overview of Company DuPont, along with its subsidiaries, is a global company offering a wide range of products and services in agriculture. DuPont’s Imprelis Herbicide was approved by the EPA in August 2010 for use as a post-emergent broadleaf weed control. It was distributed and sold in 1 gallon, 2.5 gallon and 4.5 fl. oz. size containers, primarily to pest control professionals servicing the lawn, golf, turf and weed control sectors from New Jersey to Wisconsin. DuPont’s Imprelis is registered for use in all but two states (California and New York), Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Alleged [Settled] Violations In the CAFO, EPA alleges that from October 2010 through June 2011, DuPont distributed or sold Imprelis on 320 occasions with labeling that did not include directions for use and/or warning or caution statements adequate to protect non-target terrestrial plants, thus resulting in a pesticide product that was misbranded under sections 2(q)(1)(F) and/or (G) of FIFRA. DuPont’s sales or distributions of the misbranded pesticide product Imprelis are unlawful acts under FIFRA section 12(a)(1)(E). In the CAFO, EPA also alleges that DuPont failed to timely submit eighteen field trial study reports to EPA indicating potential adverse effects from the use of Imprelis as required by FIFRA section 6(a)(2) and 40 CFR part 159, subpart D. DuPont’s failures to report are unlawful acts under FIFRA sections 12(a)(2)(B)(ii) and 12(a)(2)(N). Pesticide registrants such as DuPont who violate FIFRA are subject to maximum civil penalty of $7,500 for each offense per FIFRA section 14(a)(1), as amended. In determining an appropriate civil penalty amount, FIFRA section 14(a)(4) requires that EPA consider the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the violator’s business, the effect of the penalty on the violator’s ability to continue in business, and the gravity of the violation.","Penalty DuPont agreed to pay a civil penalty of $550,000.

Bruce Environmental Engineer Water Enforcement Division Office of Civil Enforcement, US EPA 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460 202-564-8329bruce.susan@epa.gov Civil Penalty As part of the settlement, KDOT has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $477,500. Health and Environmental Effects Discharges of stormwater runoff, including runoff from construction sites, can have a significant impact on water quality. Construction activities alter natural landscapes. During construction, earth is compacted, excavated and displaced, and vegetation is removed. These activities increase runoff and erosion, thus increasing sediment transported to receiving waters. In addition to sediment, as stormwater flows over a construction site, it can pick up other pollutants such as debris, pesticides, petroleum products, chemicals, solvents, asphalts and acids that may also contribute to water quality problems. Sediment-laden runoff can result in increased turbidity and decreased oxygen in receiving waters, which in turn results in loss of in-stream habitat for fish and other aquatic species. Sediment can kill fish directly, destroy spawning beds, suffocate fish eggs and bottom dwelling organisms, and block sunlight resulting in reduced growth of beneficial aquatic grasses. In addition, sediment can impact the treatment of drinking water resulting in higher treatment costs, and can result in the loss of drinking water reservoir storage capacity and decrease the navigational capacity of waterways. Overview of Company and Location of Sites The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) is the state agency that conducts the building, expansion, modernization and maintenance of public roads in the State of Kansas. Between 2011 and 2020, KDOT will spend an estimated $6 billion on state highway projects and $1.6 billion on local roads. KDOT also maintains bridges and administers programs for public transit, railroads and airports. EPA identified violations of stormwater requirements at four KDOT highway construction projects: U.S Highway 69 expansion, Project 91, near Pleasanton, Kansas U.S. Highway 69 expansion, Project 92, near Pleasanton, Kansas U.S. Highway 59 expansion south of Lawrence, Kansas Kansas Highway 18 construction project near Manhattan, Kansas Violations KDOT failed to comply with the conditions in the stormwater construction general permit issued by the state of Kansas pursuant to CWA Section 402, U.S.C. § 1342, resulting in the discharge of pollutants in stormwater from construction sites, which is a violation of CWA Section 301. Permit violations included the failure to install or implement adequate stormwater control measures, including the failure to timely stabilize disturbed soils, the failure to properly maintain stormwater controls, the failure to develop an adequate stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) and update the SWPPP as appropriate, and the failure to maintain the SWPPP and other records at the construction site. Missing stormwater control measures included stormwater controls at stream crossings (e.g., bridge crossings and culverts), silt fences, rock check dams, storm drain inlet protection, and slope protection in parts of the site. Numerous stormwater controls that were installed were installed incorrectly or not properly maintained. Pollutant Impacts As a result of this settlement, EPA estimates that the sediment discharged in stormwater runoff will be reduced by as much as 48 million pounds from KDOT construction sites over the first year.","$477,500"

High levels of TSS in a water body can diminish the amount of light that penetrates the water column and reduce photosynthesis and the production of oxygen. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) – BOD is an indirect measure of the biologically degradable material present in organic wastes. High BOD means there is an abundance of biologically degradable material that will consume oxygen from the water during the degradation process. It may take away oxygen that is needed for aquatic organisms to survive. Injunctive Relief The goal of the injunctive relief is to reduce the likelihood and severity of future unauthorized discharges from JCMUA’s sewer system that could pose a threat to public health and the environment. The settlement requires JCMUA to repair, upgrade and expand its infrastructure and implement an effective monitoring and reporting mechanism to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the sewer system. Overview of Sewer Authority and Facility Location JCMUA owns and operates a combined sewer collection system in Jersey City, New Jersey. JCMUA’s system includes gravity sewers, catch basins, combined sewer outfalls, floatable control facilities and interceptor sewers.

Jackson Blvd. Chicago, IL 60604 (312) 353-4191clark.jacqueline@epa.gov Microscale Chemistry and Green Chemistry SEP DuPont will spend $1.25 million to implement over an expected 3 year period the Microscale and Green Chemistry SEP, a SEP that will foster curriculum change in 7 schools in Wood County to reduce risk posed by chemicals using microscale chemistry, which reduces exposure to chemicals, and green chemistry, an approach that uses safer chemicals. The goals of this SEP include reducing the adverse impact to public health by minimizing the potential exposure to chemicals in schools, avoiding subsequent disposal issues for these materials, and enhancing science safety in all of the schools involved in the SEP. This SEP will involve close coordination with teachers and administrators in the participating schools. Fluorotelomer-based Product Biodegradation Testing SEP The Biodegradation SEP will investigate the biodegradation potential of certain chemicals to breakdown to form PFOA. The SEP, valued at $5 million and to be completed in 3 years, will evaluate nine of DuPont's commercial fluorotelomer-based products in commerce prior to the settlement. Using two types of biodegradation studies, the SEP will help the public to better understand the inherent degradation potential of fluorotelomer-based products to form PFOA and the behavior of such products when released to the environment. DuPont will use independent laboratories to perform all work associated with the Biodegradation SEP and will hire an independent third party to serve as a Panel Administrator for a Peer Consultation Panel. The Peer Consultation Panel will address specific charges related to the biodegradation studies. The public will have the opportunity to nominate Peer Consultation Panel members. DuPont has agreed to require the laboratories it contracts with to follow the Agency's Good Laboratory Practices regulations as well as prepare and follow a Quality Assurance Project Plan. DuPont and EPA agreed to amend the Biodegradation SEP after initial testing proved more difficult than anticipated. The amendment extended the timeframe for additional testing through 2013 to allow time to develop methods for analysis. After multiple attempts to characterize the chemicals by the independent lab and after review of the work by the Peer Consultation panel, the EPA and DuPont jointly agreed to modify the SEP to have the remaining funds ($1.5 million) be applied to PFOA related research by universities. On December 13, 2013, a consent order required DuPont to use the remaining SEP funds to purchase analytical instruments for two universities approved by EPA. The equipment is intended to be used for research on the presence of perfluorinated compounds in people or the environment, or research on how these chemicals react in the environment. TSCA/RCRA Settlement Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) TSCA/RCRA settlement On December 14, 2005, EPA forwarded to the Environmental Appeals Board (Board) a settlement with E.I du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) for the largest civil administrative penalty EPA has ever obtained under any federal environmental statute. The settlement resolves DuPont's violations related to the synthetic chemical perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which includes the four violations alleged in the Agency's two complaints filed against DuPont in July and December 2004,) and settles four additional counts involving information about PFOA that EPA obtained after initiating its action against DuPont. The settlement package requires DuPont to pay $10.25 million in civil penalties and perform Supplemental Environmental Projects worth $6.25 million. SDWA settlements: In 2002, EPA entered into an emergency administrative order under the Safe Drinking Water Act on consent agreement with DuPont in which DuPont agreed to provide alternative drinking water or treatment for public or private water users living near the Washington Works facility in Washington, West Virginia if the level of PFOA detected in their drinking water was greater than the PFOA screening level established by a C-8 Assessment of Toxicity team, which was formed pursuant to a state order and established the screening level for PFOA at 150 parts per billion (ppb). In 2006, after science on health effects of PFOA evolved, we entered into a second emergency administrative order that replaced the 2002 order and established a site-specific action level equal to or greater than 0.50 ppb. In 2009, after our scientists established a provisional health advisory for PFOA of 400 parts per trillion or 0.40 ppb to address short-term exposure to PFOA, we entered into a third emergency administrative order with DuPont that replaced the 2006 order and lowered the allowable concentration of PFOA in drinking water from 0.50 ppb to 0.40 ppb in communities near the facility. The provisional health advisory for PFOA was based on available evidence at that time. Each of the SDWA orders were based on site-specific information, including information gathered as part of the TSCA/RCRA settlement, that warranted action by EPA at the time.
